        "abstract": "The left atrial posterior wall ( PW ) often contains sites required for maintenance of atrial fibrillation ( AF ). Electrical isolation of the PW is an important feature of all open surgeries for AF. This study assessed the ability of current ablation techniques to achieve PW isolation ( PWI ) and its effect on recurrent AF . Fifty\u2010seven consecutive patients with persistent or high\u2010burden paroxysmal AF underwent catheter ablation, which was performed using an endocardial\u2010only (30) or a hybrid endocardial\u2013epicardial procedure (27). The catheter ablation lesion set included pulmonary vein antral isolation and a box lesion on the PW (roof and posterior lines). Success in creating the box lesion was assessed as electrical silence of the PW (voltage <0.1\u00a0mV) and exit block in the PW with electrical capture. Cox proportional hazards models were used for analysis of AF recurrence. PWI was achieved in 21 patients (36.8%), more often in patients undergoing hybrid ablation than endocardial ablation alone (51.9% versus 23.3%, P =0.05). Twelve patients underwent redo ablation. Five of 12 had a successful procedural PWI , but all had PW reconnection at the redo procedure. Over a median follow\u2010up of 302\u00a0days, 56.1% of the patients were free of atrial arrhythmias. No parameter including procedural PWI was a statistically significant predictor of recurrent atrial arrhythmias.  PWI during catheter ablation for AF is difficult to achieve, especially with endocardial ablation alone. Procedural achievement of PWI in this group of patients was not associated with a reduction in recurrent atrial arrhythmias, but reconnection of the PW was common."

The importance of defining cell composition was a new topic mentioned by most speakers. The epigenome varies between cell types and insuring that methylation differences are related to sample treatment and not a differing cell population is essential. The meeting was attended by 215 computational and bench scientists from 18 countries. There were 11 speakers, a small poster session, and a discussion session.

Similar to the primary study, substudy participants receiving vitamin E also had slower functional decline than those receiving placebo. Overall, there was no difference in the rate of functional decline between APOE \u03b54 allele carriers and noncarriers. A significant interaction was observed between treatment and the APOE genotype on AD progression: \u03b54 carriers declined faster than noncarriers in the vitamin E plus memantine treatment arm. APOE genotypes may modulate AD treatment response and should be included in the design of future randomized controlled trials."

        "abstract": "Background. Patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 have a high prevalence of vascular calcification, but the specific anatomical distribution and severity of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC), in contrast to coronary calcification, is less well documented. AAC may be recorded using plain radiographs. The present report is an analysis of baseline data on AAC in patients enrolled in the CORD (Calcification Outcome in Renal Disease) study. Methods. A total of 47 centres in six European countries participated in this cross-sectional study. Inclusion criteria were age \u226518 years and duration of dialysis \u22653 months. Lateral lumbar radiography of the abdominal aorta was used to determine the overall AAC score, which is related to the severity of calcific deposits at lumbar vertebral segments L1\u2013L4. The reliability of the method was tested by double reading of 64 radiographs (coefficient of correlation 0.9). Results. A lateral lumbar radiograph was obtained in 933 patients. Calcification (AAC score \u2265 1) was present in 81% of the patients; its severity increased significantly from L1 to L4 ( P < 0.0001) and affected all of these segments in 51% of patients. Independent predictors for the presence and severity of calcification were age (odds ratio [OR] 1.103/year; P < 0.0001), duration of dialysis (OR 1.110/year; P = 0.002) and history of cardiovascular disease (OR 3.247; P < 0.0001). Conclusions. AAC detected by lateral lumbar radiograph is associated with several risk factors of uraemic calcification. This semi-quantitative method is more widely available and less expensive than the current procedures for studying calcification and could form part of a pre-transplant workup and cardiovascular risk stratification."

        "abstract": "Nowadays, different clinical behaviors of odontogenic cysts, little information about their biological agents, importance of diagnosis, and early diagnosis of these lesions have encouraged the researchers to conduct new studies. JunB acts as a regulator of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein production and affects vessel proliferation and tissue angiogenesis. Hence, this study was conducted to compare angiogenesis through VEGF and JunB expression in odontogenic keratocysts (OKCs) and dentigerous cysts (DCs). A total of 25 paraffin blocks of OKCs and 25 DCs were included in this experimental descriptive cross-sectional study, and immunohistochemical expression of VEGF and JunB was evaluated. Percentage and score of expression were recorded for each sample, and independent t -test, Mann\u2013Whitney U, and Spearman statistical tests were run to analyze the data. The statistical significance level was set at <0.05. From 50 studied samples, 39.6% belonged to women and 60.4% belonged to men, with mean age of 34.2 \u00b1 1.7 years. The mean percentages of JunB expression were 52.88 \u00b1 17.35 and 74.6 \u00b1 18.55 for DC and OKC samples, respectively. This expression was significantly higher in OKC than DC, and it had significantly higher scores as well ( P = P = 0.0001 and 0.00033, respectively). The means of VEGF were 20.2% \u00b111.86 and 52.6% \u00b119.98 in DC and OKC samples, respectively. The mean VEGF expression was significantly higher in OKC than DC ( P = 0.045), and it had significantly higher scores, too ( P = 0.000). Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between VEGF and JunB expression in the studied samples (r s = 0.3 and P = 0.005). Based on the results of this study, it seems evaluation of angiogenesis through JunB expression can be helpful in the prediction of more aggressive behavior in pathologic lesions such as OKC."

        "abstract": "Learning styles are cognitive, emotional, and physiological traits, as well as indicators of how learners perceive, interact, and respond to their learning environments. According to Honey-Mumford, learning styles are classified as active, reflexive, theoretical, and pragmatic. The purpose of this study was to identify the predominant learning styles among pharmacy students at the Federal University of Paran\u00e1, Brazil. An observational, cross-sectional, and descriptive study was conducted using the Honey-Alonso Learning Style Questionnaire. Students in the Bachelor of Pharmacy program were invited to participate in this study. The questionnaire comprised 80 randomized questions, 20 for each of the four learning styles. The maximum possible score was 20 points for each learning style, and cumulative scores indicated the predominant learning styles among the participants. Honey-Mumford (1986) proposed five preference levels for each style (very low, low, moderate, high, and very high), called a general interpretation scale, to avoid student identification with one learning style and ignoring the characteristics of the other styles. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. This study included 297 students (70% of all pharmacy students at the time) with a median age of 21 years old. Women comprised 77.1% of participants. The predominant style among pharmacy students at the Federal University of Paran\u00e1 was the pragmatist, with a median of 14 (high preference). The pragmatist style prevails in people who are able to discover techniques related to their daily learning because such people are curious to discover new strategies and attempt to verify whether the strategies are efficient and valid. Because these people are direct and objective in their actions, pragmatists prefer to focus on practical issues that are validated and on problem situations. There was no statistically significant difference between genders with regard to learning styles. The pragmatist style is the prevailing style among pharmacy students at the Federal University of Paran\u00e1. Although students may have a learning preference that preference is not the only manner in which students can learn, neither their preference is the only manner in which students can be taught. Awareness of students\u2019 learning styles can be used to adapt the methodology used by teachers to render the teaching-learning process effective and long lasting. The content taught to students should be presented in different manners because varying teaching methods can develop learning skills in students."

A parent's involvement in the child's education has the potential to enhance academic performance. We sought to study the association between parental involvement and academic achievement among deaf children in Uganda. Using purposive consecutive sampling, one hundred and eight parents of deaf children (Primary 1 to 7) were recruited from Mulago School for the Deaf in Kampala, Uganda. The Parental Involvement Questionnaire was used to measure parents' involvement in school activities while the Wide Range Assessment Test, third edition, was used to measure academic achievement (reading, spelling and arithmetic). Linear regression was used to test the association between parental involvement and academic achievement. One hundred and five children with mean age 11.09 years (SD = 2.89) were enrolled of whom 56 (35.3%) were female. With a Beta coefficient of 0.07, a 7% unit increase of summed parental involvement showed no significant association between parental involvement and academic achievement (p = 0.46) of the deaf children. Parental involvement was not associated with academic achievement among deaf children in Kampala. Other factors associated with academic achievement need to be identified to enhance deaf children's performance at school."

        "abstract": "This scientific opinion of the EFSA Panel\u00a0on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids ( CEF Panel) deals with the safety evaluation of the recycling process Concept Plastic Packaging ( EU register No RECYC 151), which is based on the Starlinger Decon technology. The decontamination efficiency of the process was demonstrated by a challenge test. The input of this process is hot caustic washed and dried poly(ethylene terephthalate) ( PET ) flakes originating from collected post\u2010consumer PET containers, mainly bottles, containing no more than 5% of PET from non\u2010food consumer applications. In this technology, washed and dried PET flakes are preheated before being submitted to solid\u2010state polycondensation ( SSP ) in a continuous reactor (one single reactor or several reactors in parallel) at high temperature under vacuum and gas flow. Having examined the challenge test provided, the Panel\u00a0concluded that the preheating (step 2) and the decontamination in the continuous SSP reactor (step 3) are the critical steps that determine the decontamination efficiency of the process. The operating parameters that control the performance of the process are well defined and are temperature, pressure, residence time and gas flow for steps 2 and 3. Under these conditions, it was demonstrated that the recycling process under evaluation, using the Starlinger Decon technology, is able to ensure that the level of migration of potential unknown contaminants into food is below a conservatively modelled migration of 0.1\u00a0\u03bcg/kg food. Therefore, the Panel\u00a0concluded that the recycled PET obtained from this process intended to be used up to 100% for the manufacture of materials and articles for contact with all types of foodstuffs for long\u2010term storage at room temperature, with or without hotfill, is not considered of safety concern. Trays made of this PET are not intended to be used, and should not be used, in microwave and conventional ovens."

        "abstract": "Intestinal epithelial renewal is mediated by intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that exist in a state of neutral drift, wherein individual ISC lineages are regularly lost and born but ISC numbers remain constant. To test whether an active mechanism maintains stem cell pools in the Drosophila midgut, we performed partial ISC depletion. In contrast to the mouse intestine, Drosophila ISCs failed to repopulate the gut after partial depletion. Even when the midgut was challenged to regenerate by infection, ISCs retained normal proportions of asymmetric division and ISC pools did not increase. We discovered, however, that the loss of differentiated midgut enterocytes (ECs) slows when ISC division is suppressed and accelerates when ISC division increases. This plasticity in rates of EC turnover appears to facilitate epithelial homeostasis even after stem cell pools are compromised. Our study identifies unique behaviors of Drosophila midgut cells that maintain epithelial homeostasis. \u2022 Drosophila intestinal stem cell (ISC) pools do not recover after partial depletion \u2022 Ratio of symmetric/asymmetric ISC divisions remains constant during regeneration \u2022 Increasing ISC proliferation increases gut epithelial cell turnover \u2022 Decreasing ISC proliferation decreases gut epithelial cell turnover Drosophila intestinal stem cell (ISC) pools do not recover after partial depletion Ratio of symmetric/asymmetric ISC divisions remains constant during regeneration Increasing ISC proliferation increases gut epithelial cell turnover Decreasing ISC proliferation decreases gut epithelial cell turnover In this report, Edgar and colleagues showed that intestinal stem cell (ISC) pools are not actively maintained in the fly midgut; ISC pools did not recover after their partial depletion. Nevertheless, despite their compromised ISC pools, midguts maintained normal organ size and cell number, not by more frequent ISC divisions but through decreased midgut cell turnover."

        "abstract": "The secretoglobins (SCGBs) comprise a family of small, secreted proteins found in animals exclusively of mammalian lineage. There are 11 human SCGB genes and five pseudogenes. Interestingly, mice have 68 Scgb genes, four of which are highly orthologous to human SCGB genes; the remainder represent an 'evolutionary bloom' and make up a large gene family represented by only six counterparts in humans. SCGBs are found in high concentrations in many mammalian secretions, including fluids of the lung, lacrimal gland, salivary gland, prostate and uterus. Whereas the biological activities of most individual SCGBs have not been fully characterised, what already has been discovered suggests that this family has an important role in the modulation of inflammation, tissue repair and tumorigenesis. In mice, the large Scgb1b and Scgb2b gene families encode the androgen-binding proteins, which have been shown to play a role in mate selection. Although much has been learned about SCGBs in recent years, clearly more research remains to be done to allow a better understanding of the roles of these proteins in human health and disease. Such information is predicted to reveal valuable novel drug targets for the treatment of inflammation, as well as designing biomarkers that might identify tissue damage or cancer."

The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of different moisture on the constitution of bioceramic sealers. The sealers were evaluated before mixing, and after setting using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Energy Dispersive Analysis (EDX) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) techniques. Twenty four extracted teeth were prepared and assigned to four groups according to the moisture conditions: (1) dry: using ethanol as final irrigation, (2) normal: using paper points until the last one appeared dry, (3) moist: using a Luer adapter for 5\u00a0s followed by 1 paper point, and (4) wet: the canals remained totally flooded. The roots were filled with MTA Fillapex \u00ae and Endosequence \u00ae BC and kept in phosphate buffer solution at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0days. Each root was sectioned transversally and longitudinally. The sealers harvested from longitudinal sections were analysed using XRD. Whilst the transverse sections were analysed using SEM/EDX. The XRD analysis showed MTA Fillapex composed of Bismuth trioxide, calcium silicate and tricalcium aluminate. The intensity of peaks in the wet condition was reduced. Endosequence BC contained mainly calcium silicate, calcium silicate hydrate, zirconia and calcium hydroxide. The wet condition showed a small increase in hydrated calcium silicate. The EDX analysis showed changes in the elemental concentrations with different moisture conditions. The surface morphology differed with different moisture conditions. Tested sealers have different constitution that not affected by the degree of moisture. However, it changed their relative quantity."

Urantide was delivered to rats with AS via tail vein injection for 3, 7 and 14 days. Serological indicators were identified by an automated biochemical analyzer. Histomorphological changes in the cardiac tissue of rats were observed by pathological staining techniques. The expression of genes and proteins was assessed using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. Localization of proteins was detected by immunofluorescence. Overexpression of urotensin II (UII) and its receptor, G protein-coupled receptor 14 (GPR14), was observed in the hearts of rats with AS and the expression of both proteins significantly declined after urantide administration. Triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein and calcium levels were improved in rats with AS following treatment with urantide. Notably, urantide was able to antagonize the UII/GPR14 system. Urantide treatment resulted in markedly decreased expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), collagen type I/III, and genes and proteins in the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. By contrast, TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 2 (TIMP-2) levels were increased. In addition, the MMP-2/TIMP-2 protein ratio was significantly decreased in rats treated with urantide compared with AS rats with no urantide treatment. Constituents of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and collagen type I/III were found to be localized in the diseased tissue and blood vessels of the hearts of rats with AS. In conclusion, urantide was able to effectively block the UII/GPR14 system by regulating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and collagen metabolism. Inhibition of the UII/GPR14 system may prevent and potentially treat atherosclerotic myocardial fibrosis. Based on the current results, it was hypothesized that collagen metabolism may be associated with the JAK2/STAT3 pathway."

Unfortunately, the management of refractory myeloma and lymphoma remains challenging. The discovery of new immunological therapies, namely chimeric antigen receptors T cells (CAR-T), outlined unprecedented B cell malignancies results. In this context, the CAR-T-based approach has led to the proliferation of many clinical studies. In this review, we will deal with the CAR-T structure, and we will summarize the primary clinical studies assessing the risks and benefits of CAR-T cell therapy. We will also deal with the adverse events and management of cytokine release syndromes/immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Subsequently, we will review potential future improvements to overcome refractoriness and improve expansion while decreasing CAR-T\u2019s off-target effects. The advances in the CAR-T platform represent a step forward with promising unlimited future possibilities that made it a paradigm-shifting for the management of B cell malignancies."

        "abstract": "Fungal keratitis (FK) is an eye disease that can lead to blindness and has a high incidence worldwide. At present, there is no effective treatment for this disease. There are innate immune response mechanisms that protect against fungal infections. One example is C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), which can identify fungal invaders and trigger signal transduction pathways and cellular responses to eliminate pathogens. However, previous studies have focused mostly on single-receptor factors, and a systematic analysis of the genetic factors underlying the pathogenesis of FK has not been conducted. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of FK in terms of genomics and to further elucidate its pathogenesis. We performed a transcriptome analysis of a mouse model of FK using RNA sequencing to obtain the relevant gene expression profiles and to identify differentially expressed genes, signaling pathways, and regulatory networks of the key genetic factors in the pathogenesis of murine FK. Several genes that are significantly associated with FK and serve as markers of FK, such as the inflammatory cytokine genes IL1B , IL6 , IL10 , IL23 , and TNF , were identified. The mRNA and protein expression patterns of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in the corneas of mice with FK were validated by quantitative RT-PCR and Luminex multiplex assay technology. The Wnt, cGMP\u2013PKG, and Hippo signaling pathways were significantly enriched during fungal infection of mouse corneas. Our study may help to elucidate the mechanisms of FK pathogenesis and to identify additional candidate drug targets for the treatment of FK."

A total of 113 patients with NSCLC were recruited. According to their type of cancer treatment, the patients were classified into chemotherapy (n=40), targeted therapy (n=33), and untreated control (n=40) groups. All participants completed five objective tests measuring various domains of cognitive function, a subjective cognitive functioning scale (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy\u2013Cognitive Function; FACT-cog), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) either within 6 months after diagnosis (for the untreated group) or about 18 months after treatment. Overall, there were no significant intergroup differences in the proportions of patients with abnormal cognitive performance and psychiatric disturbances. Among the untreated NSCLC patients, 35% had impaired performance in at least one cognitive domain, and a comparable finding (30%\u201335%) was made for the other two treatment groups. The proportion of patients with impaired psychomotor speed was the highest (10%\u201315%) across various cognitive domains. Moreover, a significant proportion of NSCLC patients (15%\u201320%) exhibited HADS-defined anxiety and depression disorder. Finally, significant correlations were found between FACT-cog total scores and the HADS Depression subscale across all three groups. This study demonstrated that 1) a substantial proportion of NSCLC patients exhibited cognitive impairments (especially regarding psychomotor speed) and psychiatric disturbances; 2) no significant differences were observed among the three patient groups for any subjective or objective measure of cognitive deficit; and 3) perceived cognitive impairment was significantly associated with depression or anxiety. Prompt treatment of psychiatric disorders to minimize their impact is therefore recommended."

A total of three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and three non-RCTs were included for data extraction and meta-analysis. There were significant differences between the two groups regarding the postoperative pain score on postoperative day (POD) 0 and POD 1. The cumulative opioid consumption in the ACB plus LIA groups was significantly lower than that in the ACB groups on POD 0 and POD 1. No significant differences were found in terms of postoperative range of motion or length of hospitalization. ACB plus LIA significantly reduced the postoperative pain score on POD 0 and POD 1 compared with isolated ACB. In addition, ACB plus LIA was associated with a significant reduction in opioid consumption during the early postoperative period."

The detection and diagnosis of early ovarian carcinomas are still clinical challenges, which calls for imaging studies using early ovarian carcinoma animal models. The present study aimed to optimize the 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced model of rat ovarian tumors by investigating the delivery methods, induction dose and time of DMBA exposure, and explored the morphological features of tumors using MRI. Three schemes were performed. In scheme one the ovary was covered with absorbable hemostatic gauze loaded with a high concentration of liquid DMBA. For this scheme, 150 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups depending on the DMBA dose (1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 mg). In scheme two DMBA solution was injected under the ovarian capsule. For this scheme, 159 rats were divided into 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mg DMBA groups. In scheme three the ovary was covered with absorbable gauze loaded with a high concentration of solid DMBA. For this scheme 161 rats were divided into 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 mg DMBA groups. Each group of the three schemes was further subdivided into 60-, 90-, 120-, 150- and 180-day groups. In scheme two, the tumor formation rate was 75.6% (99/131), which was the highest in the 1.5 mg group (86.4%, 38/44) and reached 100% (10/10) on day 120. The induced tumors were serous in 93.9% (93/99) of tumors. Borderline ovarian tumors accounted for 19.2% (19/99) of all tumors, and ovarian cancer accounted for 46.5% (46/99). The mean maximum diameter (MMD) of borderline ovarian tumors was 10.29\u00b13.41 mm, and that of ovarian cancer was 15.19\u00b17.10 mm. MMD of the solid components increased with increasing malignancy. Cystic, cystic-solid and solid tumors were observed. The ovarian subcapsular injection of 1.5 mg DMBA was the best scheme for the rat ovarian tumor model. The present model is ideal for investigating the occurrence, development and imaging of ovarian tumors."

Atopic dermatitis exerts a profound impact on the quality of life of patients and their families. The estimated lifetime prevalence of atopic dermatitis has increased 2~3 fold during over the past 30 years, especially in urban areas in industrialized countries, emphasizing the importance of life-style and environment in the pathogenesis of atopic diseases. While the interplay of individual genetic predisposition and environmental factors contribute to the development of atopic dermatitis, the recent increase in the prevalence of atopic dermatitis might be attributed to increased exposure to various environmental factors rather than alterations in human genome. In recent decades, there has been an increasing exposure to chemicals from a variety of sources. In this study, the effects of various environmental chemicals we face in everyday life - air pollutants, contact allergens and skin irritants, ingredients in cosmetics and personal care products, and food additives - on the prevalence and severity of atopic dermatitis are reviewed."

We aimed to define better assay for detecting immune status of health care personnel to vaccine\u2010preventable diseases. Mumps and rubella antibodies of health care personnel at Shimane University Hospital were examined by hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI), comparing with those by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). A total of 910 sera from health care personnel were tested. There was poor correlation between HI and EIA in detecting mumps antibodies with correlation coefficient values ( r )\u00a0= 0.190 ( P < 0.001), but in rubella antibodies HI and EIA were relatively well correlated ( r = 0.930, P < 0.001). Seropositivity rate of HI versus EIA was found to be 65.7 versus 93.2, and 89.5 versus 86.5% for mumps and rubella, respectively. As compared with EIA, HI identified sixfold larger seronegative subjects in mumps. Moreover, in mumps, 88.8% of seronegative subjects detected by HI were seropositive by EIA, while 3.7% of seropositive subjects detected by HI were seronegative by EIA. In rubella, 2.1% of seronegative subjects detected by HI were seropositive by EIA, and 1.7% of seropositive by HI was seronegative by EIA. Considerable difference between HI and EIA in determining immune status of health care personnel to mumps and rubella suggests beneficial use of EIA for the identification of accurate susceptible personnel who subsequently undergo an effective vaccination programs. Seroprevalence survey of health care personnel by using appropriate assay is essential for prevention and infection control strategies in health care settings."

Significant kinetic differences exist among specific types of volleyball serves and spikes. Controlled laboratory study. Fourteen healthy female collegiate volleyball players performed 5 successful trials of 4 skills: 2 directional spikes, an off-speed roll shot, and the float serve. Volunteers who were competent in jump serves (n, 5) performed 5 trials of that skill. A 240-Hz 3-dimensional automatic digitizing system captured each trial. Multivariate analysis of variance and post hoc paired t tests were used to compare kinetic parameters for the shoulder and elbow across all the skills (except the jump serve). A similar statistical analysis was performed for upper extremity kinematics. Forces, torques, and angular velocities at the shoulder and elbow were lowest for the roll shot and second-lowest for the float serve. No differences were detected between the cross-body and straight-ahead spikes. Although there was an insufficient number of participants to statistically analyze the jump serve, the data for it appear similar to those of the cross-body and straight-ahead spikes. Shoulder abduction at the instant of ball contact was approximately 130\u00b0 for all skills, which is substantially greater than that previously reported for female athletes performing tennis serves or baseball pitches. Because shoulder kinetics were greatest during spiking, the volleyball player with symptoms of shoulder overuse may wish to reduce the number of repetitions performed during practice. Limiting the number of jump serves may also reduce the athlete\u2019s risk of overuse-related shoulder dysfunction. Volleyball-specific overhead skills, such as the spike and serve, produce considerable upper extremity force and torque, which may contribute to the risk of shoulder injury."

Our data showed that overexpression of miR-138 in \u03b3\u03b4 T\u00a0cells obtained miR-138-rich \u03b3\u03b4TDEs accompanying increased expansion and cytotoxicity of \u03b3\u03b4 T\u00a0cells. \u03b3\u03b4TDEs inherited the cytotoxic profile of \u03b3\u03b4 T\u00a0cells and could efficiently deliver miR-138 to OSCC cells, resulting in synergetic inhibition on OSCC both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo . The pre-immunization by miR-138-rich \u03b3\u03b4TDEs inhibited the growth of OSCC tumors in immunocompetent C3H mice, but not in nude mice, suggesting an immunomodulatory role by miR-13-rich \u03b3\u03b4TDEs. \u03b3\u03b4TDEs and miR-138 additively increased the proliferation, interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) production, and cytotoxicity of CD8 + T\u00a0cells against OSCC cells. Only delivered by \u03b3\u03b4TDEs can miR-138 efficiently target programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and CTLA-4 in CD8 + T\u00a0cells. We conclude that \u03b3\u03b4TDEs delivering miR-138 could achieve synergetic therapeutic effects on OSCC, which is benefited from the individual direct anti-tumoral effects on OSCC and immunostimulatory effects on T\u00a0cells by both \u03b3\u03b4TDEs and miR-138; \u03b3\u03b4TDEs could serve as an efficient DDS for microRNAs (miRNAs) in the treatment of cancer."

A multicenter, retrospective cohort study was conducted using patient data extracted from the Turkish National Electronic Database. All patients who tested positive for COVID-19 (PCR test) between 11 March through to 30 May 2020 were screened for eligibility ( n =\u2009149,671). Following exclusion of patients based on pre-determined inclusion criteria, patients with T2DM using a DPP-4i or glucose-lowering medications other than a DPP-4i were compared for mortality and hospitalization. The propensity score method was used to match age, gender, micro- and macrovascular complications, and medications in the two groups. Independent associates of mortality were analyzed using multivariable analysis on the whole T2DM population. A total of 33,478 patients with T2DM who tested postive for COVID-19 who met the inclusion criteria were included in the analysis. Median (interquartile range) age was 54 (22) years and 42.4% were male. Of these, 9100 patients using DPP-4is ( n =\u20094550) or other glucose-lowering drugs ( n =\u20094550) were matched in two groups. After matching, analysis revealed a lower mortality in the DPP-4i group (9.5 vs. 11.8%; p <\u20090.001). In the multivariable model, the use of DPP-4is (odds ratio [OR] 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35\u20130.91; p =\u20090.02) was associated with lower mortality in the whole sample, while age, male gender, computed tomography finding of COVID-19, obesity, low glomerular filtration rate, and an insulin-based regimen also predicted increased risk of death. There was no association between the preexisting treatment with DPP-4is and COVID-19-related hospitalization in the matched analysis or multivariate model. The rate of admission to the intensive care unit and/or mechanical ventilation favored the DPP-4i group (21.7 vs. 25.2%; p =\u20090.001), although this association became saturated in the multivariate analysis (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39\u20131.08; p =\u20090.099). The results of this study demonstrate an association between DDP-4i use and reduced mortality in people with T2DM who tested PCR positive for COVID-19."

We designed a new indwelling catheter type that has a balloon, 4 peripheral grooves, and a C-shaped groove on its surface. In addition, there is a flushing channel, a balloon channel, and a urine drainage channel in the catheter body. However, the most critical characteristic is that the flushing channel and the 4 peripheral grooves are connected with the C-shaped groove, and the flushing liquid can reach the C-shaped groove through the flushing channel and then flow out through the peripheral grooves, while the balloon channel leads to the balloon. Generally, our design is to add 4 peripheral grooves, a C-shaped groove, and a flushing channel to the indwelling catheter that is applied clinically nowadays. We designed a new type of indwelling catheter, which is multifunctional, and we had acquired a national patent in China. In theory, the new catheter type cannot only be used for urine drainage, bladder irrigation, but also for urethral flushing, urethral excretion drainage, and local urethral drug delivery at the same time. This new indwelling catheter can theoretically reduce catheter-associated urinary tract infection and facilitate urethral secretion drainage or flushing out, which is especially suitable for the treatment and nursing of patients who underwent urethral operation. However, the new catheter have not been produced and tested clinically, and this is our next step."

        "abstract": "Italian treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) target good glycemic control but acknowledge the associated risk of hypoglycemia. Unlike traditional antidiabetic therapies, modern treatment options such as fixed-ratio combinations of basal insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists are associated with improved glycemic control, reduced body weight and low risk of hypoglycemia. The cost-effectiveness of the fixed-ratio combinations of basal insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists IDegLira and iGlarLixi was assessed for Italy in patients with T2DM uncontrolled on basal insulin, to evaluate how short-term clinical benefits translate into long-term health economic outcomes. The IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model was used to project clinical and economic outcomes over patient lifetimes. Treatment effects were sourced from an indirect treatment comparison. The analysis captured direct medical costs (expressed in 2017 Euros) from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service (NHS) and patient-related quality of life. Sensitivity analyses were performed. IDegLira was associated with gains of 0.09 life years and 0.13 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) relative to iGlarLixi, due to a lower cumulative incidence and delayed onset of diabetes-related complications. IDegLira was associated with an incremental cost of EUR 930 over patient lifetimes, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EUR 7,386 per QALY gained. Over the lifetime of patients with T2DM uncontrolled on basal insulin, IDegLira was associated with improved clinical outcomes at higher costs relative to iGlarLixi. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of EUR 30,000 per QALY gained, IDegLira was considered to be cost-effective versus iGlarLixi from the perspective of the Italian NHS."

Unfortunately, there are currently no specific medicines that can better treat these coronaviruses. Drug repurposing is an effective and economical strategy for drug discovery from existing drugs, natural products, and synthetic compounds. In this review, the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of valinomycin (VAL), especially its activity against coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), were summarized, it highlights that VAL has tremendous potential for use as a novel antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2."

        "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment composed of a mixture of stromal cells and their secretions has a marked impact on cancer progression. In particular, soluble factors and metabolites contribute to malignancy through the dysregulation of autophagy in cancer cells. The present study investigated the effects of ovarian cancer-associated fibroblasts (OVCAFs) with their secretory substances on the autophagy and migration of ovarian cancer cells. The conditioned-medium (CM) of OVCAFs isolated from fresh human ovarian cancer tissues was analyzed for the levels of 27 common cytokines/chemokines using a cytokine array. Autophagy in cancer cells was assessed by determining the expression of the vacuolar form of LC3 by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. Cancer cell migration was assessed by Transwell migration assay. Interleukin (IL)-8 was found to be the most highly upregulated cytokine among the cytokines/chemokines found in the OVCAF-CM. The role of IL-8 in ovarian cancer cell migration and its mechanistic link with autophagy was investigated. Recombinant human IL-8 (rhIL-8) stimulated the migration of SKOV3 and Kuramochi ovarian cancer cells, and concurrently downregulated basal autophagy, in concentration-dependent manner. Compared to the CM of control counterpart normal fibroblasts isolated from benign ovaries (OVNF-CM), the CM from 3 OVCAF isolates (namely, OVCAF-9, -20 and -43) exerted effects similar to rhIL-8 on both cancer cell lines. The pharmacological induction of autophagy with rapamycin or metformin attenuated the pro-migratory effects of IL-8. Neutralizing anti-IL-8 antibody counteracted the inhibitory effect of OVCAF-CM on basal autophagy. On the whole, the present study highlights the involvement of IL-8 released by CAFs in the ovarian tumor microenvironment in promoting cancer cell migration through the suppression of autophagy."

Although recent technical advances in O -GlcNAc site-mapping methods combined with mass spectrometry (MS) techniques have facilitated study of the fundamental roles of O -GlcNAcylation in cellular processes, an efficient technique for examining the dynamic, reciprocal relationships between O -GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation is needed to provide greater insights into the regulatory functions of O -GlcNAcylation. Here, we describe a strategy for selectively identifying both O -GlcNAc- and phospho-modified sites. This strategy involves metal affinity separation of O -GlcNAcylated and phosphorylated peptides, \u03b2-elimination of O -GlcNAcyl or phosphoryl functional groups from the separated peptides followed by dithiothreitol (DTT) conjugation (BEMAD), affinity purification of DTT-conjugated peptides using thiol affinity chromatography, and identification of formerly O -GlcNAcylated or phosphorylated peptides by MS. The combined metal affinity separation and BEMAD approach allows selective enrichment of O -GlcNAcylated peptides over phosphorylated counterparts. Using this approach with mouse brain synaptosomes, we identified the serine residue at 605 of the synapsin-1 peptide, 603 QASQAGPGPR 612 , and the serine residue at 692 of the tau peptide, 688 SPVVSGDTSPR 698 , which were found to be potential reciprocal O -GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation sites. These results demonstrate that our strategy enables mapping of the reciprocal site occupancy of O -GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation of proteins, which permits the assessment of cross-talk between these two PTMs and their regulatory roles."

        "abstract": "DNA-reactive compounds target actively proliferating cells. Therefore, they are presupposed to kill cancer cells selectively, and many of them are used as chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we have discovered a cell death pathway involving nc886 and PKR as another mechanism for the cytotoxicity. Our study provides an insight how a proapoptotic protein responds to a DNA-reactive compound via a regulatory noncoding RNA (ncRNA) as a molecular signal. Since the nc886/PKR pathway operates in most normal cells including nonproliferating ones, our finding may answer to a conundrum why a DNA-damaging compound harms quiescent cells and is of future clinical utility by considering nc886/PKR when designing a chemotherapeutic regimen with minimal side effects on normal cells. DNA-reactive compounds are harnessed for cancer chemotherapy. Their genotoxic effects are considered to be the main mechanism for the cytotoxicity to date. Because this mechanism preferentially affects actively proliferating cells, it is postulated that the cytotoxicity is specific to cancer cells. Nonetheless, they do harm normal quiescent cells, suggesting that there are other cytotoxic mechanisms to be uncovered. By employing doxorubicin as a representative DNA-reactive compound, we have discovered a cytotoxic mechanism that involves a cellular noncoding RNA (ncRNA) nc886 and protein kinase R (PKR) that is a proapoptotic protein. nc886 is transcribed by RNA polymerase III (Pol III), binds to PKR, and prevents it from aberrant activation in most normal cells. We have shown here that doxorubicin evicts Pol III from DNA and, thereby, shuts down nc886 transcription. Consequently, the instantaneous depletion of nc886 provokes PKR and leads to apoptosis. In a short-pulse treatment of doxorubicin, these events are the main cause of cytotoxicity preceding the DNA damage response in a 3D culture system as well as the monolayer cultures. By identifying nc886 as a molecular signal for PKR to sense doxorubicin, we have provided an explanation for the conundrum why DNA-damaging drugs can be cytotoxic to quiescent cells that have the competent nc886/PKR pathway."

Astragaloside IV (ASV) is an active component of Radix Astragali , which has been demonstrated to exert protective effects against endothelial damage. The present study explored whether microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in mediating the protective effects of ASV on ox-LDL-induced damage in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). RNA sequencing and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analyses revealed that ox-LDL treatment significantly downregulated miR-140-3p expression in HUVECs. miR-140-3p overexpression promoted cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in ox-LDL-induced HUVECs. However, inhibition of miR-140-3p expression could reverse the effects of ASV on ox-LDL-induced HUVECs and reactivate ASV-inhibited PI3K/Akt signaling in ox-LDL-induced HUVECs. In addition, Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) was identified as a target of miR-140-3p in ox-LDL-treated HUVECs. Subsequent experiments revealed that KLF4 overexpression partially counteracted the protective effects of miR-140-3p or ASV treatment in ox-LDL-induced HUVECs. Taken together, the current findings demonstrated that the protective effects of ASV on HUVECs were dependent on miR-140-3p upregulation and subsequent inhibition of KLF4 expression, which in turn suppressed the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The present results shed light to the molecular mechanism by which ASV alleviated ox-LDL-induced endothelial cell damage."

However, little is known regarding the effects of switching from donepezil 5 mg/day to galantamine 16 or 24 mg/day, or regarding the effects of adding memantine to established therapy compared with increasing the dose of donepezil. This report discusses two studies conducted to evaluate treatment with galantamine and memantine with respect to cognitive benefits and caregiver evaluations in patients with AD receiving donepezil 5 mg/day for more than 6 months. Patients with mild or moderate AD (scores 10\u201322 on the Mini-Mental State Examination) were enrolled in the Galantamine Switch study and switched to galantamine (maximum doses 16 mg versus 24 mg). Patients with moderate to severe AD (Mini-Mental State Examination scores 3\u201314) were enrolled in the Donepezil Increase versus Additional Memantine study and either had their donepezil dose increased to 10 mg/day or memantine 20 mg/day added to their existing donepezil dose. Patients received the study treatment for 28 weeks and their Disability Assessment for Dementia, Mental Function Impairment Scale, Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores were assessed with assistance from their caregivers. For the Galantamine Switch study after 8 weeks, agitation evaluated by the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory improved in both the 16 mg and 24 mg groups compared with baseline. However, there were no significant differences between the two galantamine groups. Agitation was also less in patients in the additional memantine group than in the donepezil increase group. In summary, switching to galantamine from donepezil and addition of memantine in patients with AD receiving donepezil were both safe and meaningful treatment options, and particularly efficacious for suppression of agitation."

        "abstract": "Stress ulcers and related upper gastrointestinal bleeding are well-known complications in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) has been widely prescribed in noncritically ill patients who are at low risk for clinically significant bleeding, which is then injudiciously continued after hospital discharge. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of inappropriate prescribing of PPI-based preventative therapy in ICU versus non-ICU patients that subsequently continued postdischarge, and to estimate the costs incurred by the unwarranted outpatient continuation of PPI therapy. A retrospective review of patient data at a major teaching hospital in Korea was performed. During the 4-year study period, adult patients who were newly initiated on PPI-based SUP during hospital admission and subsequently discharged on a PPI without a medical indication for such therapy were captured for data analysis. The incidence rates of inappropriate prescribing of PPIs were compared between ICU and non-ICU patients, and the costs associated with such therapy were also examined. A total of 4,410 patients, more than half of the inpatient-initiated PPI users, were deemed to have been inadvertently prescribed a PPI at discharge in the absence of a medical need for acid suppression. The incidence of inappropriate outpatient continuation of the prophylaxis was higher among ICU patients compared with non-ICU patients (57.7% versus 52.2%, respectively; P =0.001). The total expenditure accrued through the continuation of nonindicated PPI therapy was approximately US$40,175. This study confirmed that excess usage of PPIs for SUP has spread to low-risk, non-ICU patients. The overuse of unwarranted PPI therapy can incur large health care expenditure, as well as clinical complications with minimal therapeutic benefits. Educating clinicians regarding SUP guidelines and the adverse effects of long-term use of acid suppression can improve the cost effectiveness of PPI therapy."

Both natural infection and live\u2010attenuated vaccine strain (LVS) confer good protection against tularaemia. LVS vaccination is traditionally administered by scarification, and the formation of a cutaneous reaction or take at the vaccination site is recognised as a clinical correlate of protection. Although previous studies have suggested that high antibody titres following vaccination might serve as a useful surrogate marker, the immunological correlates of protection remain unknown. We investigated the host T\u2010cell\u2010mediated immune (T\u2010CMI) responses elicited following immunisation with LVS vaccine formulated by the DynPort Vaccine Company (DVC\u2010LVS) or the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID\u2010LVS). We compared T\u2010CMI responses prompted by these vaccines and correlated them with take size. We found that both LVS vaccines elicited similar T\u2010CMI responses. Interestingly, take size associated with the T cells\u2019 ability to proliferate, secrete IFN\u2010\u03b3 and mobilise degranulation, suggesting that these responses play an essential role in tularaemia protection. These results renew the appreciation for vaccination through the scarification as a prime route of inoculation to target pathogens driving specific T\u2010CMI responses and provide further evidence that T\u2010CMI plays a role in protection from tularaemia. The actual immunological correlate(s) of protection from tularaemia in humans remain(s) unknown. As with smallpox, take is widely accepted as a clinical correlate of protection against tularaemia. We report, for the first time, a correlation between take\u2010lesion size and cellular\u2010mediated immune responses in humans after tularaemia immunization. "

Recently, increasing attention has been paid to long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which play significant roles in tumorigenesis and progression. However, little is known about the potential role of the lncRNA urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) in NPC cell invasion and migration. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to analyze the expression of lncRNA UCA1 in NPC cell lines and NP69. lncRNA UCA1 knock-down nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line models were established through siRNA. Cell viability was evaluated by Cell counting kit-8 and Colony forming assay. The migration and invasion capacities were evaluated by wound healing and transwell migration and invasion assays. Western blot analysis were used to examine protein changes followed by UCA1 knock-down. Our study confirmed that UCA1 was upregulated in NPC cell lines and involved in NPC tumorigenesis according to our established UCA1-associated competing endogenous RNA network. Moreover, functional analyses indicated that the downregulation of UCA1 exerted inhibitory effects on cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. Mechanistic analyses revealed that UCA1 was the target of miR-145 and functioned as a sponge to repress miR-145 expression. Rescue experiments suggested that lncRNA UCA1 reversed the miR-145-mediated inhibition on oncogene ADAM17 expression, thus promoting the proliferation, invasion, and migration of NPC cells. LncRNA UCA1 functions as a tumor promoter in NPC. UCA1 promotes the proliferation and invasion of NPC cells by sponging miR-145, functionally altering ADAM17 expression targeted by miR-145. Our exploration of the underlying mechanism of UCA1 in NPC may provide novel therapeutic targets for NPC."

        "abstract": "The persistence of the motivational salience of drug-related environmental cues and contexts is one of the most problematic obstacles to successful treatment of drug addiction. Behavioral approaches to extinguishing the salience of drug-associated cues, such as cue exposure therapy, have generally produced disappointing results which have been attributed to, among other things, the context specificity of extinction and inadequate consolidation of extinction learning. Extinction of any behavior or conditioned response is a process of new and active learning, and increasing evidence suggests that glutamatergic neurotransmission, a key component of the neural plasticity that underlies normal learning and memory, is also involved in extinction learning. This review will summarize findings from both animal and human studies that suggest that pharmacological enhancement of glutamatergic neurotransmission facilitates extinction learning in the context of drug addiction. Pharmacological agents that have shown potential efficacy include NMDA partial agonists, mGluR5 receptor positive allosteric modulators, inhibitors of the GlyT1 glycine transporter, AMPA receptor potentiators, and activators of the cystine-glutamate exchanger. These classes of cognition-enhancing compounds could potentially serve as novel pharmacological adjuncts to cue exposure therapy to increase success rates in attenuating cue-induced drug craving and relapse."

        "abstract": "Safeguarding cell function and identity following a genotoxic stress challenge entails a tight coordination\u00a0of DNA damage signaling and repair with chromatin maintenance. How this coordination is achieved and with what impact on chromatin integrity remains elusive. Here, we address these questions by investigating the mechanisms governing the distribution in mammalian chromatin of the histone variant H2A.X, a central player in damage signaling. We reveal that H2A.X is deposited de novo at sites of DNA damage in a repair-coupled manner, whereas the H2A.Z variant is evicted, thus reshaping the chromatin landscape at repair sites. Our mechanistic studies further identify the histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) as responsible for the deposition of newly synthesized H2A.X. Functionally, we demonstrate that FACT potentiates H2A.X-dependent signaling of DNA damage. We propose that new H2A.X deposition in chromatin reflects DNA damage experience and may help tailor DNA damage signaling to repair progression. \u2022 H2A.X is deposited de novo at sites of DNA damage repair, whereas H2A.Z is evicted \u2022 FACT promotes new H2A.X deposition coupled to repair synthesis \u2022 FACT stimulates H2A.X-dependent signaling of DNA damage \u2022 H2A.X is not only a starting point of damage signaling but also an output of repair H2A.X is deposited de novo at sites of DNA damage repair, whereas H2A.Z is evicted FACT promotes new H2A.X deposition coupled to repair synthesis FACT stimulates H2A.X-dependent signaling of DNA damage H2A.X is not only a starting point of damage signaling but also an output of repair Histone variants convey epigenetic information and define functional chromatin states. Piquet et\u00a0al. describe a reshaping of histone variant patterns at sites of UVC damage repair with H2A.Z removal followed by de novo deposition of H2A.X. The H2A.X deposition machinery provides a means for fine-tuning DNA damage signaling."

We analyzed costs for type 2 diabetes and associated complications in 3,125 patients. These data were obtained from the Korean National Diabetes Program (KNDP), a large, ongoing, prospective cohort study that began in 2005. The cost data were prospectively collected, using an electronic database, for the KNDP cohort at six hospitals. The costs were analyzed according to complications for 1 yr from enrollment in the study. Among 3,125 patients, 918 patients had no vascular complications; 1,883 had microvascular complications only; 51 had macrovascular complications only; and 273 had both complications. The annual direct medical costs for a patient with only macrovascular, only microvascular, or both macrovascular and microvascular complications were 2.7, 1.5, and 2.0 times higher than the medical costs of patients without complications. Annual direct medical costs per patient increased with the number of microvascular complications in patients without macrovascular complications. The economic costs for type 2 diabetes are attributable largely to the management of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Proper management of diabetes and prevention of related complications are important for reducing medical costs."

This has never been described before as the sole cytogenetic abnormality in a bone marrow cell clone at onset. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization with properly designed bacterial artificial chromosome probes, we mapped the breakpoint regions on both derivative chromosomes 2 and 10: der(2) and der(10), respectively. The MPP7 gene, disrupted by the breakpoint on chromosome 10, was juxtaposed upstream of both HNRNA3 and NFE2L2 genes on chromosome 2, without the formation of any fusion gene. Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we tested the possible disregulation of any of the breakpoint-associated genes as a consequence of the translocation, but we found no statistically significant alteration. Considering the potential role of this clonal cytogenetic abnormality in leukemogenesis, we speculate that this translocation could have an impact on additional genes mapping outside the breakpoint regions. However, the limited amount of RNA material available prevented us from testing this hypothesis in this present case."

        "abstract": "Background and aim: The Integrated Narrative Nursing Model (INNM) is an approach that integrates the qualitative methodology typical of the human sciences, with the quantitative methodology more often associated with the natural sciences. This complex model, which combines a focus on narrative with quantitative measures, has recently been effectively applied to the assessment of chronic patients. In this study, the model is applied to the planning phase of education (Integrated Narrative Nursing Education, INNE), and proves to be a valid instrument for the promotion of the current educational paradigm that is centered on the engagement of both the patient and the caregiver in their own path of care. The aim of this study is therefore to describe the nurse\u2019s strategy in the planning of an educational intervention by using the INNE model. Methods: The case of a 70-year-old woman with pulmonary neoplasm is described at her first admission to Hospice. Each step conducted by the reference nurse, who uses INNE to record the nurse-patient narrative and collect subsequent questionnaires in order to create a shared educational plan, is also described. Results: The information collected was submitted, starting from a grounded methodology to the following four levels of analysis: I. Needs Assessment, II. Narrative Diagnosis, III. Quantitative Outcome, IV. Integrated Outcome. Step IV, which is derived from the integration of all levels of analysis, allows a nurse to define, even graphically, the conceptual map of a patient\u2019s needs, resources and perspectives, in a completely tailored manner. Conclusion: The INNE model offers a valid methodological support for the professional who intends to educate the patient through an inter-subjective and engaged pathway, between the professional, their patient and the socio-relational context. It is a matter of adopting a complex vision that combines processes and methods that require a steady scientific basis and advanced methodological expertise with active listening and empathy \u2013 skills which require emotional intelligence."

Studies conducted to improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines have shown that understanding the mechanism of action of DNA vaccines might be the key to successfully improving their immunogenicity. Our current understanding is that DNA vaccines induce innate and adaptive immune responses in two ways: (1) encoded protein (or polypeptide) antigen(s) by the DNA plasmid can be expressed in stromal cells (i.e., muscle cells) as well as DCs, where these antigens are processed and presented to na\u00efve CD4 or CD8 T cells either by direct or cross presentation, respectively; and (2) the transfected DNA plasmid itself may bind to an un-identified cytosolic DNA sensor and activate the TBK1-STING pathway and the production of type I interferons (IFNs) which function as an adjuvant. Recent studies investigating double-stranded cytosolic DNA sensor(s) have highlighted new mechanisms in which cytosolic DNA may release secondary metabolites, which are in turn recognized by a novel DNA sensing machinery. Here, we discuss these new metabolites and the possibilities of translating this knowledge into improved immunogenicity for DNA vaccines."

        "abstract": "Microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system, are critical for synaptic pruning and maintenance and for mitigating injury and neurodegeneration. Determining whether microglia\u2013neuron interactions are beneficial in specific instances has been difficult, largely because of the local and transient nature of the interactions. Using simultaneous optical coherence tomography/scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) and adaptive optics SLO retinal imaging in mice, we show interactions of microglia and photoreceptors over time scales from seconds to months during injury, degeneration, and repair. In vivo optical assessment of photoreceptor signaling in a large neuronal field encompassing the injured area allows us to relate the time course of these microglia movements to that of the tissue remodeling and functional recovery. Microglia respond to damage and microenvironmental changes within the central nervous system by morphologically transforming and migrating to the lesion, but the real-time behavior of populations of these resident immune cells and the neurons they support have seldom been observed simultaneously. Here, we have used in vivo high-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy with and without adaptive optics to quantify the 3D distribution and dynamics of microglia in the living retina before and after local damage to photoreceptors. Following photoreceptor injury, microglia migrated both laterally and vertically through the retina over many hours, forming a tight cluster within the area of visible damage that resolved over 2 wk. In vivo OCT optophysiological assessment revealed that the photoreceptors occupying the damaged region lost all light-driven signaling during the period of microglia recruitment. Remarkably, photoreceptors recovered function to near-baseline levels after the microglia had departed the injury locus. These results demonstrate the spatiotemporal dynamics of microglia engagement and restoration of neuronal function during tissue remodeling and highlight the need for mechanistic studies that consider the temporal and structural dynamics of neuron\u2013microglia interactions in vivo."

NPM/B23 phosphorylated by CDK2-cyclin E acquires a high binding affinity to Rho-associated kinase (ROCK II), and physically associates with ROCK II. The NPM/B23-binding results in super-activation of ROCK II, which is a critical event for initiation of centrosome duplication. The activation of ROCK II also requires the binding of Rho small GTPase to the auto-inhibitory region; hence the availability of the active Rho protein is an important aspect of the centrosomally localized ROCK II to properly initiate centrosome duplication. There are three isoforms of Rho (RhoA, B, and C), all of which are capable of binding to and priming the activation of ROCK II. Here, we investigated which Rho isoform(s) are involved in the activation of ROCK II in respect to the initiation of centrosome duplication. We found that both RhoA and RhoC, but not RhoB, were required for initiation of centrosome duplication, and over-activation of RhoA as well as RhoC, but not RhoB, promoted centrosome duplication and centrosome amplification."

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of primary liver cancer, and is also highly resistant to conventional chemotherapy treatments. In this study, we report that Longikaurin A (LK-A), an ent-kaurane diterpenoid isolated from the plant Isodon ternifolius , induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human HCC cell lines. LK-A also suppressed tumor growth in SMMC-7721 xenograft models, without inducing any notable major organ-related toxicity. LK-A treatment led to reduced expression of the proto-oncogene S phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2) in SMMC-7721 cells. Lower Skp2 levels correlated with increased expression of p21 and p-cdc2 (Try15), and a corresponding decrease in protein levels of Cyclin B1 and cdc2. Overexpression of Skp2 significantly inhibited LK-A-induced cell cycle arrest in SMMC-7721 cells, suggesting that LK-A may target Skp2 to arrest cells at the G2/M phase. LK-A also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells. LK-A induced phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase and P38 MAP kinase. Treatment with, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 prevented LK-A-induced apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells. Moreover, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine prevented phosphorylation of both JNK and c-Jun. Taken together, these data indicate that LK-A induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells by dampening Skp2 expression, and thereby activating the ROS/JNK/c-Jun signaling pathways. LK-A is therefore a potential lead compound for development of antitumor drugs targeting HCC."

Mice are a common model organism to study effects on bone and bone marrow, necessitating a standardized and efficient method for long bone dissection and bone marrow isolation for processing of large experimental cohorts. We describe a straightforward dissection procedure for the removal of the femur and tibia that is suitable for downstream applications, including but not limited to histomorphologic analysis and strength testing. In addition, we outline a rapid procedure for isolation of bone marrow from the long bones via centrifugation with limited handling time, ideal for cell sorting, primary cell culture, or DNA, RNA, and protein extraction. The protocol is streamlined for rapid processing of samples to limit experimental error, and is standardized to minimize user-to-user variability."

In all, 24 eyes of 22 patients that required treatment with single or multiple intravitreal dexamethasone implants for refractory DMO were included in the study. Patients having macular oedema for another retinal disease were excluded from the study. The patient data were collected and analyzed retrospectively. As a demographic data age, gender, the type of diabetes and the duration of DMO were collected. Changes in central foveal thickness and the number of hyper reflective spots (HRS) were analyzed with Heidelberg SD-OCT. Furthermore, the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and changes in the intraocular pressure (IOP) were measured. In all, 50.0% of the eyes with baseline BCVA 0.45 (\u00b12.4) lines in ETDRS LogMAR scale received only one implant during the follow-up of 332 (\u00b179) days. At the end of the follow-up, BCVA was 0.26 (\u00b12.0) lines. The other 50.0% of the eyes with baseline BCVA 0.64 (\u00b13.0) lines received the second implant in 156 (\u00b138) days. Central retinal thickness (CRT) at baseline was 333 (\u00b144) \u03bcm in the eyes with only one implant and 497 (\u00b1125) \u03bcm in the eyes with 2 or more implants. IOP lowering medication was needed for 8.3% of the eyes. The decrease in the number of HRS was significant (8\u00b117, p=0.048) in response to dexamethasone implantation. The dexamethasone implant is a useful treatment in refractory DMO and HRS seen in the OCT might indicate inflammation in the retina."

Retrospective cohort study from 2010 to mid-2016 with data from the regional Laboratory Database and three national databases on antibiotic prescriptions, hospital admission, and mortality, respectively. Primary care patients (\u226518 years) empirically treated for UTI caused by non-ESBL- or ESBL-producing E. coli (non-ESBL and ESBL E. coli ) were included. Seven antibiotics, commonly used empirically for UTI, were investigated. Treatment failure measured as the redemption of a new antibiotic prescription or admission to hospital due to UTI. Cox proportional hazard ratios and adjusted risk differences along with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for 14 and 30 days, respectively. Thirty-six thousand two hundred and ninety-three (95.7%) and 1624 (4.3%) cases were included in the non-ESBL and ESBL groups, respectively. Male sex, high age, ESBL production, and resistance to empirical therapy were found to independently increase the risk of treatment failure. Compared to pivmecillinam, ciprofloxacin had significantly lower treatment failure for non-ESBL E. coli , but significantly higher treatment failure in ESBL E. coli . There was no significant difference between nitrofurantoin and pivmecillinam. All antibiotics seem to have a higher risk of treatment failure for UTI caused by ESBL-producing E. coli as compared to non-ESBL-producing E. coli . At present, nitrofurantoin and pivmecillinam seem to be the most relevant orally available therapies for E. coli UTI. Local resistance data should guide which of the two that should be the contemporary first-line option."

In this study we report our findings on the cognitive functionality of three cohorts of older men in a rural area. This is the first data published on the cognitive functionality of older men from Jamaica. The investigation was carried out with the administration of a 132-item questionnaire. The measure includes items on demographics, retirement and health status, the seeking and avoidance of medical care, health treatment, medication use, childhood illness, happiness and the mini-mental status examination. The measure was given to 2,000 men 55 years and older who were randomly selected from St. Catherine. The multivariate analysis of the model revealed three significant determinants of cognitive functionality: Age (OR = 0.346, 95% CI = 0.206, 0.582), social support (OR = 0.683, 95% CI = 0.443, 1.053) and having children (OR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.130, 5.183). There is a negative relationship between age and cognitive functionality and a positive relationship between having children and cognitive functionality. Our main conclusions are that the two significant determinants of cognitive functionality of older men (age and having children) in Jamaica are unique given the many determinants of cognitive functioning cited in the scientific literature. The plethora of factors points to the need for further research to understand the range of factors that influence the cognitive functionality of older Jamaicans."

There are some disparate effects that patients may experience after sleeve gastrectomy including a reduction in BMI, weight, blood pressure, stroke, and cancer and also a significant remission in obesity-related diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D), Non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and craniopharyngioma-related hypothalamic obesity as well as non-obesity-related diseases such as gout, musculoskeletal problems, ovarian disorders and urinary incontinence. The most common complications of sleeve gastrectomy are bleeding, nutrient deficiencies, and leakage. There are several studies on the impact of gender and ethnic disparities on post-operative complications. This study collects state of the art of reports on sleeve gastrectomy. The aim of this study was to analyze recent studies and review the advantages and disadvantages of sleeve gastrectomy.

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Caralluma russeliana stem extract on some physiological parameters in streptozotocin induced diabetes in male Wistar rats after 8 weeks. The experimental rats were randomly assigned into four groups. Rats of group 1 were normal controls. Rats of group 2 were diabetic controls. Rats of group 3 were diabetic rats treated with C. russeliana stem extract. Rats of group 4 were non-diabetic rats, subjected to C. russeliana stem extract. The lowest body weight gain was noticed in diabetic rats of group 2. Serum glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, ALP, total bilirubin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and uric acid levels were significantly elevated in diabetic rats of group 2; however, total serum protein, albumin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly reduced in diabetic rats of group 2. Treatments with C. russeliana stem extract in diabetic rats revealed notable diminishing and protecting effects of physiological modifications. Therefore, this study revealed the significance of using C. russeliana stem extract as a promising remedial agent to treat diabetes and its complications."

This study was conducted during May\u2013November 2012 around five mine dumps in South Africa. Communities in close proximity to mine dumps had an increased likelihood of current wheeze OR 1.38 (95\u2009% CI: 1.10\u20131.71), rhinoconjunctivitis OR 1.54 (95\u2009% CI: 1.29\u20131.82), and a protective association with asthma OR 0.29 (95\u2009% CI: 0.23\u20130.35). Factors associated with health outcomes included other indoor and outdoor pollution sources. Wheeze and rhinoconjunctivitis appear to be a public health problem in these communities. The findings of this study serve as a base for further detailed epidemiological studies for communities in close proximity to the mine dumps e.g. a planned birth cohort study."

        "abstract": "As the incidence of COVID-19 increases with time, more and more efforts are made to pave a way out for the therapeutic strategies to deal with the disease progression. Inflammation being a significant influencer in COVID-19 patients, it drives our focus onto the signaling cascades of the JAK/STAT pathway. JAK phosphorylation mediated by cytokine receptor activation leads to phosphorylation of STATs that translocate into the nucleus to translate for inflammatory mediators. The SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins like spike, nucleocapsid, membrane and envelope proteins along with the non- structural proteins 1-16 including proteases like 3CL pro and PL pro promote its entry and survival in hosts. The SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers inflammation via the JAK/STAT pathway leading to recruitment of pneumocytes, endothelial cells, macrophages, monocytes, lymphocytes, natural killer cells and dendritic cells progressing towards cytokine storm. This produces various inflammatory markers in the host that determine the disease severity. The JAK/STAT signaling also mediates immune responses via B cell and T cell differentiation.With an attempt to reduce excessive inflammation, JAK/STAT inhibitors like Ruxolitinib, Baricitinib, Tofacitinib have been employed that mediate its actions via suppressors of cytokine signaling, cytokine inducible SH2 containing protein, Protein inhibitor of activated STAT and protein tyrosine phosphatases. Even though they are implicated with multiple adverse effects, the regulatory authorities have supported its use, and numerous clinical trials are in progress to prove their safety and efficacy. On the contrary, the exact mechanism of JAK/STAT inhibition at molecular levels remains speculative for which further investigations are required."

        "abstract": "Supine hypertension affects a majority of patients with autonomic failure; it is associated with end\u2010organ damage and can worsen daytime orthostatic hypotension by inducing pressure diuresis and volume loss during the night. Because sympathetic activation prevents blood pressure (BP) from falling in healthy subjects exposed to heat, we hypothesized that passive heat had a BP\u2010lowering effect in patients with autonomic failure and could be used to treat their supine hypertension. In Protocol 1 (n=22), the acute effects of local heat (40\u201342\u00b0C applied with a heating pad placed over the abdomen for 2\u00a0hours) versus sham control were assessed in a randomized crossover fashion. Heat acutely decreased systolic BP by \u221219\u00b14\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg (versus 3\u00b14 with sham, P <0.001) owing to decreases in stroke volume (\u221218\u00b15% versus \u22124\u00b14%, P =0.013 ) and cardiac output (\u221215\u00b15% versus \u22122\u00b14%, P =0.013). In Protocol 2 (proof\u2010of\u2010concept overnight study; n=12), we compared the effects of local heat (38\u00b0C applied with a water\u2010perfused heating pad placed under the torso from 10 pm to 6 am ) versus placebo pill. Heat decreased nighttime systolic BP (maximal change \u221228\u00b16 versus \u22122\u00b16\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg, P <0.001). BP returned to baseline by 8 am . The nocturnal systolic BP decrease correlated with a decrease in urinary volume ( r =0.57, P =0.072) and an improvement in the morning upright systolic BP ( r =\u22120.76, P =0.007). Local heat therapy effectively lowered overnight BP in patients with autonomic failure and supine hypertension and offers a novel approach to treat this condition. Future studies are needed to assess the long\u2010term safety and efficacy in improving nighttime fluid loss and daytime orthostatic hypotension.

We aimed to assess whether sputum concentrations of Human Neutrophil Peptides (HNP), Neutrophil Elastase (NE), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), and Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), major products of neutrophils and macrophages, could be used to trace airway inflammation and progression towards pulmonary functional impairment characteristic of COPD. Forty-two symptomatic smokers and 42 COPD patients underwent pulmonary function tests; sputum samples were collected at enrolment, and 6 months after smoking cessation. HNP, NE, IL-8, MMP-9 levels were increased in individuals with COPD ( p < 0.0001). HNP and NE concentrations were higher in patients with severe airways obstruction, as compared to patients with mild-to-moderate COPD ( p = 0.002). A negative correlation was observed between FEV 1 and HNP, NE and IL-8 levels ( p < 0.01), between FVC 1 /FVC and HNP, NE and IL-8 levels ( p < 0.01), and between NE enrolment levels and FEV 1 decline after 2 years ( p = 0.04). ROC analysis, to discriminate symptomatic smokers and COPD patients, showed the following AUCs: for HNP 0.92; for NE 0.81; for IL-8 0.89; for MMP-9 0.81; for HNP, IL-8 and MMP-9 considered together 0.981. The data suggest that the measurement of sputum markers may have an important role in clinical practice for monitoring COPD."

In this context, governments from all around the world suspended all education, industry and business activities, alongside restricting the movement of people. Nevertheless, during this period, the activity of the law enforcement and the forensic investigators never stopped. At the present time, clinical and forensic autopsies of SARS-CoV-2 virus-positive cases, as well as handling of potentially infected biological samples in forensic practice have given guidance. However, less attention has been given to the development of specific adjustments to the existing crime scene investigation protocols and procedures for this exceptional time. This manuscript aims to share the methods and strategies adopted for the investigation of high priority criminal cases during the pandemic. Furthermore, other pandemic-related processes are critically explored, in order to propose adjustments for any forensic services to be prepared to face similar challenges in the future. The overall goal of this manuscript is to provide a summary of the main measures and the procedures developed to make the operations possible, while safeguarding the technicians in the field and the activity in the forensic laboratory. In order to minimize the risk of infection for personnel, adjustments to the standard practice have been proposed for each of the different phases of crime scene management, i.e. CSI call policy, equipment preparation, working groups, procedure at the scene, chain of custody and analyses of the evidence at the forensic lab. As this is a current study, based on limited cases and limited sources in the literature, changes and updates to the indications provided in this paper may be needed in the near future, according to new virologic data epidemiological trends."

        "abstract": "Individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia have an exceptionally high risk for tobacco dependence. Postmortem studies show that these individuals have significant reductions in \u03b1 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in several brain areas. Decreased \u03b1 7-mediated function might not only be linked to schizophrenia but also to increased tobacco consumption. The purpose of this study was to determine whether pharmacological blockade of \u03b1 7 nAChRs would increase motivation of rats to intravenously self-administer nicotine (NIC) during a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement (PR). Before PR, rats received local infusions of 0, 10, or 20\u2009pmol of a selective \u03b1 7 nAChR antagonist, \u03b1 -conotoxin ArIB [V11L,V16D] (ArIB) into the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell or the anterior cingulate cortex, brain areas that contribute to motivation for drug reward. We additionally sought to determine whether local infusion of 0, 10, or 40\u2009nmol of a selective \u03b1 7 nAChR agonist, PNU 282987, into these brain areas would decrease motivation for NIC use. Infusion of ArIB into the NAc shell and anterior cingulate cortex resulted in a significant increase in active lever pressing, breakpoints, and NIC intake, suggesting that a decrease in \u03b1 7 nAChR function increases motivation to work for NIC. In contrast, PNU 282987 infusion resulted in reductions in these measures when administered into the NAc shell, but had no effect after administration into the anterior cingulate cortex. These data identify reduction of \u03b1 7 nAChR function as a potential mechanism for elevated tobacco use in schizophrenia and also identify activation of \u03b1 7 nAChRs as a potential strategy for tobacco cessation therapy."

This is a prospective randomized study of 70 patients with T2DM with coronary disease who underwent oral surgery. The study was double blind with respect to the glycemia measurements. Blood glucose levels were continuously monitored for 24 hours using the MiniMed Continuous Glucose Monitoring System. Patients were randomized into two groups: 35 patients received 5.4 mL of 2% lidocaine, and 35 patients received 5.4 mL of 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. Hemodynamic parameters (blood pressure and heart rate) and anxiety levels were also evaluated. There was no difference in blood glucose levels between the groups at each time point evaluated. Surprisingly, both groups demonstrated a significant decrease in blood glucose levels over time. The groups showed no significant differences in hemodynamic and anxiety status parameters. The administration of 5.4 mL of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine neither caused hyperglycemia nor had any significant impact on hemodynamic or anxiety parameters. However, lower blood glucose levels were observed. This is the first report using continuous blood glucose monitoring to show the benefits and lack of side effects of local anesthesia with epinephrine in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary disease."

However, the effects and possible mechanisms of circRNAs in retinoblastoma (RB) are far from clear. circVAPA expression pattern was identified by RT-qPCR. circVAPA induced effects on RB cells were tested by CCK-8, clone forming, flow cytometry and transwell assays. Bioinformatics assay, rescue experiments and dual-luciferase tests were applied for mechanism exploration. Additionally, mouse models were established for in vivo assays. circVAPA was upregulated in human RB specimen and RB cell lines, and was correlated with poor outcomes of Rb patients. Knockdown of circVAPA could suppress the malignant phenotypes of RB. Mechanistic experiments demonstrated that miR-615-3p could reverse the circVAPA induced effects on RB cells, and the downstream oncogene SMARCE1 was positively regulated by circVAPA via miR-615-3p . Further, in vivo analysis confirmed the findings. In summary, circVAPA promoted RB proliferation and metastasis by sponging miR-615-3p , thereby upregulating SMARCE1 . CircVAPA was a potential biomarker for Rb therapy."

        "abstract": "Transplantation has made a considerable difference to the lives of many patients. However, feedback from patients indicates that although having a transplant is a hugely positive experience, having to take medications indefinitely is one of the biggest challenges. An ideal scenario would be no medications following a transplant. A compromise would be a minimal number of medications, with minimal restrictions and as simple a regimen as possible. Although there is considerable research going into fine-tuning the management of the immune response to a transplant, to date there is no universal regimen that enables patients to remain free of immunosuppressant medications, making adherence paramount to maintain long-term allograft survival. This paper reviews the available immunosuppressant regimens and factors influencing choice from both the clinician\u2019s and the patient\u2019s perspective. Factors influencing the decision-making process, such as quality of life for patients, their satisfaction, acceptability, and adherence uptake are reviewed. We conclude with a further assessment of patient choice as a factor in regimen selection, its impact on adherence, and its implications."

In this report, we present the first studies of the whole coding sequence of the MC4R gene in 243 Polish obese children and adolescents (the mean relative body mass index [RBMI] was 163.6). In addition, 101 non-obese adults were also analyzed. Direct sequencing facilitated the identification of six missense (K73R, V103I, T112M, S127L, M215L, and I251L) and one silent (c.756\u00a0C\u2009>\u2009T) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Two non-synonymous polymorphisms (K73R and M215L) appeared to be novel and one was found in obese patients (M215L, one patient) and one in non-obese adults (K73R, one person). The overall frequency of non-synonymous variant carriers reached 4.1% and 6.9% in obese patients and non-obese adults, respectively. Only one obesity-associated variant (127L) was found in two obese patients (0.82%) and in two non-obese adults (1.98%). The obesity-protecting variants (103I and 251L) appeared to be the most common in both groups: 3.3% and 4.0%, respectively. It was also observed that the RBMI in obese children and adolescents carrying the minor variants did not differ significantly from the non-carriers; however, the expected trends for the associated and protecting variants were observed. We conclude that the contribution of the MC4R gene variants to the pathogenesis of obesity in Polish children and adolescents is low."

We therefore explored whether a similar inverse correlation existed in humans between body mass index (BMI) and hippocampal N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), a marker of neuronal integrity and putatively, neuroplasticity. We also studied the relationship of a potentially neurotoxic process, worry, to hippocampal NAA in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and control subjects (CS). We combined two previously studied cohorts of GAD and control subjects. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging ( 1 H MRSI) in medication-free patients with GAD (n\u00a0=\u00a029) and a matched healthy control group (n\u00a0=\u00a022), we determined hippocampal concentrations of (1) NAA (2) choline containing compounds (CHO), and (3) Creatine\u00a0+\u00a0phosphocreatine (CR). Data were combined from 1.5\u00a0T and 3\u00a0T scans by converting values from each cohort to z-scores. Overweight and GAD diagnosis were used as categorical variables while the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) and Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) were used as dependent variables. Overweight subjects (BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a025) exhibited lower NAA levels in the hippocampus than normal-weight subjects (BMI\u00a0<\u00a025) (partial Eta-squared\u00a0=\u00a00.14) controlling for age, sex and psychiatric diagnosis, and the effect was significant for the right hippocampus in both GAD patients and control subjects. An inverse linear correlation was noted in all subjects between right hippocampal NAA and BMI. High scores on the PSWQ predicted low hippocampal NAA and CR. Both BMI and worry were independent inverse predictors of hippocampal NAA. Overweight was associated with reduced NAA concentrations in the hippocampus with a strong effect size. Future mechanistic studies are warranted. \u2022 Overweight people show reduced concentrations of hippocampal N-acetylaspartate (NAA). \u2022 Reduced NAA reflects reduced neuronal viability. \u2022 There is an inverse relationship between BMI and hippocampal NAA. \u2022 Worry scores are independently associated with lower NAA. \u2022 Generalized anxiety disorder did not show low hippocampal NAA.

Understanding the deformation mechanisms of olivine is important for addressing the dynamic processes in Earth\u2019s upper mantle. It has been thought that dislocation creep is the dominant mechanism because of extrapolated laboratory data on the plasticity of olivine at pressures below 0.5 GPa. However, we found that dislocation-accommodated grain boundary sliding (DisGBS), rather than dislocation creep, dominates the deformation of olivine under middle and deep upper mantle conditions. We used a deformation-DIA apparatus combined with synchrotron in situ x-ray observations to study the plasticity of olivine aggregates at pressures up to 6.7 GPa (that is, ~200-km depth) and at temperatures between 1273 and 1473 K, which is equivalent to the conditions in the middle region of the upper mantle. The creep strength of olivine deforming by DisGBS is apparently less sensitive to pressure because of the competing pressure-hardening effect of the activation volume and pressure-softening effect of water fugacity. The estimated viscosity of olivine controlled by DisGBS is independent of depth and ranges from 10 19.6 to 10 20.7 Pa\u00b7s throughout the asthenospheric upper mantle with a representative water content (50 to 1000 parts per million H/Si), which is consistent with geophysical viscosity profiles. Because DisGBS is a grain size\u2013sensitive creep mechanism, the evolution of the grain size of olivine is an important process controlling the dynamics of the upper mantle."

        "abstract": "This paper aims to contribute to the analysis of expectations and belief reversals in a evolutionary and complexity economics framework. It formulates its analysis in terms of the concept of reflexivity, drawing on the ideas regarding reflexivity in financial markets of George Soros, and lays out a model of how a financial cycle expresses a systematic pattern of interacting feedback effects. The paper develops this analysis as a complex interaction between sets of heterogeneous expectations derived from the behavior of reflexive economic agents. Positive and negative feedback phases in a cycle are distinguished and associated with boom and bust stages of that cycle. A central role is played by agents\u2019 beliefs and judgments underlying their expectations, and how those beliefs and judgments in uncertain circumstances are changeable and subject to abrupt reversals which can manifest themselves in \u201cMinsky moments.\u201d The paper argues that agents\u2019 belief reversals result from\u00a0their misconceptions about causal processes in booms and upswings, a misconception that reflects their tendency to think causally in terms of negative feedback patterns rather than positive ones."

        "title": "Re-Envisioning the Canadian Nephrology Trials Network: A Can-SOLVE-CKD Stakeholder Meeting of Patient Partners and Researchers",
        "abstract": "The Canadian Nephrology Trials Network (CNTN) was formed in 2014 to support Canadian researchers in developing, designing, and conducting prospective studies in nephrology. In response to the changing landscape and needs within the Canadian nephrology research community, an interest in further growth and development of the network was identified. In the following report, we describe the process undertaken to re-envision the network through the creation of 3 new committees and how the committees are facilitating change and growth within the CNTN for future sustainability. To understand areas for improvement and capacity building, the organization charged with overseeing the CNTN, Canadians Seeking Solutions and Innovations to Overcome Chronic Kidney Disease (Can-SOLVE CKD), began by conducting an environmental scan. As well, 2 informal surveys were sent to nephrology professionals (who were members of the CNTN and the Canadian Society of Nephrology) and patient partners (from Can-SOLVE CKD). In September 2018, 44 CNTN members and other stakeholders from across Canada (including patient partners and representatives from research funding agencies) convened for a 2-day visioning workshop in Mississauga, Ontario. The agenda for this workshop was largely based on the results from the informal surveys. CNTN leadership participated and chose other workshop participants through informal stakeholder mapping and purposeful recruitment. Patient partners were recruited to participate in the workshop through advertisement within the Can-SOLVE-CKD patient council. The survey results and discussion questions were presented to participants at the workshop who, in turn, discussed in large- and small-group session ways in which the CNTN might be expanded. Surveys of patient partners indicated that they would like to see greater involvement of patients in the research process. Surveys of researchers indicated that they wanted more support and resources for coordinating prospective trials. The themes which emerged from the workshop discussions were peer review, engagement, and training. These themes were broadened and formally re-named to Scientific Operations, Communications and Engagement, and Capacity Building. A working committee, each co-led by a nephrologist with research experience and a patient partner, was created to advance each of these identified themes. An executive committee was created to provide overall strategic leadership and governance to the network. The Scientific Operations Committee conducts peer reviews; provides letters of endorsement after peer review; and holds semi-annual in-person meetings where researchers can present their proposals and obtain feedback from multiple stakeholders, including patients. The Communications and Engagement Committee publishes a quarterly newsletter, engages the community on Twitter, and reaches out to community sites and new nephrologists to engage them in research. The Capacity Building Committee conducts webinars to encourage patient partners to develop their own research questions and is developing a hub-and-spoke model to improve research collaboration. We did not conduct formal stakeholder mapping. Only attendees of the visioning workshop provided input, and not everyone\u2019s comment or opinion was included in the workshop report. Perspectives were limited to the sample of people who attended the workshop or were surveyed and may not reflect perspectives of all stakeholders in nephrology research in Canada. We did not use formal qualitative methodology to summarize the workshops. Renewed areas of focus and related committees within the CNTN could lead to an increased capacity for nephrology research, increased engagement and collaboration with researchers, a higher likelihood of funding with rigorous peer review, and more clinical trials and multicenter collaborative prospective research being conducted in Canada."

        "abstract": "We explored the impact of mutations in the NOTCH1, FBW7 and PTEN genes on prognosis and downstream signaling in a well-defined cohort of 47 pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients. In T-ALL lymphoblasts, we identified high frequency mutations in NOTCH1 (n=16), FBW7 (n=5) and PTEN (n=26). NOTCH1 mutations resulted in 1.3-3.3-fold increased transactivation of a HES1 reporter construct over wild-type NOTCH1; mutant FBW7 resulted in further augmentation of reporter gene activity. NOTCH1 and FBW7 mutations were accompanied by increased median transcripts for NOTCH1 target genes (HES1, DELTEX1, cMYC). However, none of these mutations were associated with treatment outcome. Elevated HES1, DELTEX1 and cMYC transcripts were associated with significant increases in transcript levels of several chemotherapy relevant genes, including MDR1, ABCC5, reduced folate carrier, asparagine synthetase, thiopurine methyltranserase, Bcl-2 and dihydrofolate reductase. PTEN transcripts positively correlated with HES1 and cMYC transcript levels. Our results suggest that ( 1 ) multiple factors should be considered with attempting to identify molecular-based prognostic factors for pediatric T-ALL, and ( 2 ) depending on the NOTCH1 signaling status, modifications in the types or dosing of standard chemotherapy drugs for T-ALL, or combinations of agents capable of targeting NOTCH1, AKT and/or mTOR with standard chemotherapy agents may be warranted."

Factors associated with relapses can help to manage and prevent relapses. In addition, patients and doctors all pay attention to it. However, there are differences between studies. Our aim is to summarize factors associated with relapses in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). PubMed, EMBASE, Web of science, Cochrane library, CNKI, Wanfang, SinoMed, and VIP were searched to identify risk factors about relapses in RRMS, which should be in cohort or case-control studies. This article was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The quality of studies was evaluated by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Meta-analysis, subgroup and sensitivity analyses, and publication bias were all performed with Stata. This research has been registered on the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO, CRD42019120502). 43 articles were included. Infection, postpartum period, risk gene, stress, and vitamin D were risk factors for relapses in RRMS. Pregnancy period was the protective factor. Among those, infection increased the risk of relapses in infection period (relative risk [RR], 2.07 [confidence interval (CI), 1.64 to 2.60]). Women in the postpartum period increased the risk of relapses compared with women before pregnancy (RR, 1.43 [CI, 1.19 to 1.72]), or women in pregnancy period (RR, 2.07 [CI, 1.49 to 2.88]). Women in the pregnancy period decreased the risk of relapses (RR, 0.56 [CI, 0.37 to 0.84]) compared with women before pregnancy. However, fewer studies, heterogeneity, and sample size were the limitations. It is reliable to adopt results about infection, pregnancy period, and postpartum period."

        "abstract": "While imported falciparum malaria has been increasingly reported in recent years in Korea, clinicians have difficulties in making a clinical diagnosis as well as in having accessibility to effective anti-malarial agents. Here we describe an unusual case of imported falciparum malaria with severe hemolytic anemia lasting over 2 weeks, clinically mimicking a coinfection with babesiosis. A 48-year old Korean man was diagnosed with severe falciparum malaria in France after traveling to the Republic of Benin, West Africa. He received a 1-day course of intravenous artesunate and a 7-day course of Malarone (atovaquone/proguanil) with supportive hemodialysis. Coming back to Korea 5 days after discharge, he was readmitted due to recurrent fever, and further treated with Malarone for 3 days. Both the peripheral blood smears and PCR test were positive for Plasmodium falciparum . However, he had prolonged severe hemolytic anemia (Hb 5.6 g/dl). Therefore, 10 days after the hospitalization, Babesia was considered to be potentially coinfected. A 7-day course of Malarone and azithromycin was empirically started. He became afebrile within 3 days of this babesiosis treatment, and hemolytic anemia profiles began to improve at the completion of the treatment. He has remained stable since his discharge. Unexpectedly, the PCR assays failed to detect DNA of Babesia spp. from blood. In addition, during the retrospective review of the case, the artesunate-induced delayed hemolytic anemia was considered as an alternative cause of the unexplained hemolytic anemia."

        "abstract": "Breast carcinoma is one of the most malignant tumors, severely influencing the physical and mental health of people. The latest epidemiological and clinical studies have found that breast tumor and inflammation are determinate relationships with each other. Inflammation is an essential component of the tumor microenvironment, and the change of inflammatory cells might influence tumor progression, such as neoplastic cell proliferation, migration, invasion, the collapse of antitumor immunity, metastasis and so forth. Peripheral blood tests at the time of diagnosis and treatment can reflect inflammatory conditions within the neoplasm. Evaluation of peripheral blood parameters including white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, platelet counts, as well as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (d-NLR) (neutrophil count divided by the result of white blood cell count minus neutrophil count), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), which are indicators of systematic inflammatory response, have been widely proposed as prognostic factors for many malignancies. To intensively study the relationship between the common markers in peripheral blood and the treatment or prognosis of breast cancer will have critical clinical significance and application prospect, and can provide useful information for the clinicians. Herein, we review the research progress in the prognostic role of the peripheral blood in breast cancer to provide a new method for the treatment and prognosis of breast cancer."

In the first 3 months of treatment there was no statistically significant difference in bleeding on probing between incisors with and without elastomeric modules ( P = 0.125 and 0.508, respectively). The difference in plaque accumulation was not statistically significant ( P = 0.78). The difference in probing depths between the incisors was not statistically significant ( P = 0.84). The microbiological analysis showed no difference. Based on this preliminary 3 months study, elastomeric modules were not significantly associated with any increased risk during treatment when compared to self-ligating brackets. The longer term studies are needed to further confirm the findings of the present study."

Prevalence data are needed to plan interventions. We set out to estimate the prevalence of trachoma in each evaluation unit of grouped districts (\u201cworedas\u201d) in Benishangul Gumuz region, Ethiopia.  Methods : We conducted seven cross-sectional community-based surveys, covering 20 woredas, between December 2013 and January 2014, as part of the Global Trachoma Mapping Project (GTMP). The standardized GTMP training package and methodologies were used.  Results : A total of 5828 households and 21,919 individuals were enumerated in the surveys. 19,583 people (89.3%) were present when survey teams visited. A total of 19,530 (99.7%) consented to examination, 11,063 (56.6%) of whom were female. The region-wide age- and sex-adjusted trichiasis prevalence in adults aged \u226515 years was 1.3%. Two evaluation units covering four woredas (Pawe, Mandura, Bulen and Dibate) with a combined rural population of 166,959 require implementation of the A, F and E components of the SAFE strategy (surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness and environmental improvement) for at least three years before re-survey, and intervention planning should begin for these woredas as soon as possible.  Conclusion : Both active trachoma and trichiasis are public health problems in Benishangul Gumuz, which needs implementation of the full SAFE strategy."

Due to cultural and social diversity in different societies and age groups, application of specific questionnaires is essential to perform investigations about physical activities. The aim of this study is development and evaluation of psychometric properties of a self-regulation questionnaire about leisure time physical activity in Iranian male adolescents. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2013, and data of 603 male students from 12 high schools in Isfahan were collected. A comprehensive literature review and similar questionnaire review were conducted and 25 items were selected or developed to measure self-regulation. Comprehensibility of items was evaluated in a pilot study and an expert panel evaluated face and content validity. Exploratory factors analysis (EFA) was used for evaluation of construct validity and extraction of sub-constructs of self-regulation. Leisure time physical activity was assessed using International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The mean age of the participants was 16.3 years (SD =1.0) and the range was 15-19 years. Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficient of the questionnaire in the pilot and main study was 0.84 and 0.90, respectively. EFA resulted in four sub-constructs including \u201cenlistment of social support\u201d, \u201cgoal setting\u201d, \u201cself-construction\u201d, and \u201cself-monitoring\u201d, which explained 63.6% of the variance of self-regulation. Results of this investigation provide some support to the validity and reliability of the 16-item questionnaire of self-regulation abut leisure time physical activity in the target group."

In this study, assessment of BCG-specific IgG-secreting peripheral plasmablasts, was used to identify active TB in these high-risk groups. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from patients with TB and controls and cultured in vitro using an assay called Antibodies in Lymphocyte Supernatant, which measures spontaneous IgG antibody release from migratory plasmablasts. A BCG-specific ELISA and flow cytometry were used to quantify in vivo activated plasmablasts in blood samples from Ethiopian subjects who were HIV negative or HIV positive. Patients diagnosed with different clinical forms of sputum-negative active TB or other diseases (n=96) were compared with asymptomatic individuals including latent TB and non-TB controls (n=85). Immunodiagnosis of TB also included the tuberculin skin test and the interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 release assay, QuantiFERON. This study demonstrated that circulating IgG+ plasmablasts and spontaneous secretion of BCG-specific IgG antibodies were significantly higher in patients with active TB compared with latent TB cases and non-TB controls. BCG-specific IgG titres were particularly high among patients coinfected with TB and HIV with CD4\u2005T-cell counts <200\u2005cells/ml who produced low levels of Mycobacterium tuberculosis -specific IFN\u03b3 in vitro. These results suggest that BCG-specific IgG-secreting peripheral plasmablasts could be successfully used as a host-specific biomarker to improve diagnosis of active TB, particularly in people who are HIV positive, and facilitate administration of effective treatment to patients. Elevated IgG responses were associated with impaired peripheral T-cell responses, including reduced T-cell numbers and low M tuberculosis -specific IFN\u03b3 production."

Compared to children with ALL and no DS (non\u2010 DS \u2010 ALL ), those with DS and ALL ( DS \u2010 ALL ) harbor uncommon genetic alterations, suggesting DS \u2010 ALL could have distinct biological features. Recent studies have implicated several genes on chromosome 21 in DS \u2010 ALL , but the precise mechanisms predisposing children with DS to ALL remain unknown. Our integrated genetic/epigenetic analysis revealed that DS \u2010 ALL was highly heterogeneous with many subtypes. Although each subtype had genetic/epigenetic profiles similar to those found in non\u2010 DS \u2010 ALL , the subtype distribution differed significantly between groups. The Philadelphia chromosome\u2010like subtype, a high\u2010risk B\u2010cell lineage variant relatively rare among the entire pediatric ALL population, was the most common form in DS \u2010 ALL . Hypermethylation of RUNX 1 on chromosome 21 was also found in DS \u2010 ALL , but not non\u2010 DS \u2010 ALL . RUNX 1 is essential for differentiation of blood cells, especially B cells; thus, hypermethylation of the RUNX 1 promoter in B\u2010cell precursors might be associated with increased incidence of B\u2010cell precursor ALL in DS patients."

To address this knowledge gap, we used repeat forest inventory data from 92,285 trees across four large permanent plots (4\u201325\u00a0ha in size) in temperate mixed forests in northeast China to ask the following questions: (1) How do soil conditions and stand age drive biomass demographic processes? (2) How do vegetation quality (i.e., functional trait diversity and composition) and quantity (i.e., initial biomass stocks) influence biomass demographic processes independently from soil conditions and stand age? (3) What is the relative contribution of growth, recruitment, and mortality to net biomass change? Using structural equation\u00a0modeling, we showed that all three demographic processes were jointly constrained by multiple abiotic and biotic factors and that mortality was the strongest determinant on net biomass change over time. Growth and mortality, as well as functional trait diversity and the community\u2010weighted mean of specific leaf area (CWM SLA ), declined with stand age. By contrast, high soil phosphorous concentrations were associated with greater functional diversity and faster dynamics (i.e., high growth and mortality rates), but associated with lower CWM SLA and initial biomass stock. More functionally diverse communities also had higher recruitment rates, but did not exhibit faster growth and mortality. Instead, initial biomass stocks and CWM SLA were stronger predictors of biomass growth and mortality, respectively.

        "abstract": "One consequence of central nervous system injury or disease is the impairment of neural control of movement, resulting in spasticity and paralysis. To enhance recovery, restorative neurology procedures modify altered, yet preserved nervous system function. This review focuses on functional electrical stimulation (FES) and spinal cord stimulation (SCS) that utilize remaining capabilities of the distal apparatus of spinal cord, peripheral nerves and muscles in upper motor neuron dysfunctions. FES for the immediate generation of lower limb movement along with current rehabilitative techniques is reviewed. The potential of SCS for controlling spinal spasticity and enhancing lower limb function in multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury is discussed. The necessity for precise electrode placement and appropriate stimulation parameter settings to achieve therapeutic specificity is elaborated. This will lead to our human work of epidural and transcutaneous stimulation targeting the lumbar spinal cord for enhancing motor functions in spinal cord injured people, supplemented by pertinent human research of other investigators. We conclude that the concept of restorative neurology recently received new appreciation by accumulated evidence for locomotor circuits residing in the human spinal cord. Technological and clinical advancements need to follow for a major impact on the functional recovery in individuals with severe damage to their motor system."

Herein, we report a case of fasciolopsiasis in a 22-year-old man who was admitted in the hospital with abdominal pain, distension and loss of appetite for a month. He had previously diagnosed with acute viral hepatitis but, his abdominal pain was not resolving despite improvement in his liver function and general condition. During endoscopy an adult digenean worm was seen in the first part of the duodenum. After isolation, the worm was identified morphologically as Fasciolopsis buski . Microscogic examination of the patient\u2019s stool revealed eggs with a morphology consistent with F. buski . Eggs were yellow-brown, ellipsoidal, unembmbryonated, operculated, filled with yolk cells, with thin shell and ranging 118\u2013130 \u03bcm in length and 60\u201369 \u03bcm in width. The abdominal pain of the patient was resolved after treatment with praziquantel. By the present study, it was confirmed for the first time that fasciolopsiasis is indigenously transmitted in Nepal. Accordingly, the epidemiological studies in humans and reservoir host animals should be performed intensively in near future."

        "abstract": "Chloride (Cl) is an established key electrolyte for the activation of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system. Recent studies have shown the serum Cl as a key electrolyte for the regulation of body fluid distribution in heart failure (HF) patients. The clinical differences of worsening HF status according to the changes in serum Cl concentration are unclear. Data from 47 chronic HF patients were analysed. Upon worsening HF, each patient exhibited at least two HF\u2010related signs. Blood tests included haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (Ht), mean red blood cell volume (MCV), albumin, serum solutes, and b\u2010type natriuretic peptide. The relative change in the plasma volume (%PV) from stable to worsening HF was estimated as follows: 100\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0{Hb (stable)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0[1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Ht (worse)]}/{Hb (worse)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0[1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Ht (stable)]}\u00a0\u2212\u00a0100. When patients were divided into two groups based on changes in serum Cl concentration from stable to worsening HF, the pathophysiologic features of the patients with increased Cl (range 1\u201323\u00a0mEq/L; n =\u00a031) included a greater increase in serum sodium (2.94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.15 vs. \u22120.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.75\u00a0mEq/L, P =\u00a00.005), higher vascular expansion (12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.1 vs. 4.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.94%, P =\u00a00.026), a tendency towards a greater MCV (1.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.36 vs. \u22120.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.88\u00a0fL, P =\u00a00.065), and preserved renal function defined by the absence of an increase of serum creatinine (\u22120.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.39 vs. \u22120.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12\u00a0mg/dL, P =\u00a00.057) compared to patients with non\u2010increased Cl (range \u22129 to 0\u00a0mEq/L; n =\u00a016). Clinically, the increased Cl group had fewer HF signs (2.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.71 vs. 3.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.79, P =\u00a00.005) although the change in symptoms did not differ between groups (48% vs. 63%, P =\u00a00.54). The present study suggests a new clinical entity of worsening HF status, that is, HF with increased vs. non\u2010increased serum Cl concentration from clinical stability to worsening HF."

The patient presented with contralateral sciatica, worsening low back pain and urinary retention few days following the injection, followed by worsening motor functions in L4/L5/S1 myotomes with resultant dense foot drop. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging suggested infective arachnoiditis with diffuse enhancement and clumping of the nerve roots within the lumbar and sacral thecal sac. As the number of injections in the management of back pain and lumbo-sacral radicular pain is increasing annually, it is imperative to have a thorough understanding of this potentially dangerous complication and educate the patients appropriately."

        "abstract": "Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Nrf2 play a critical role in chemotherapeutic resistance. These two genes have been found to be dysregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). The purpose of this study was to analyze the expression, function and clinical prognostic relationship of Shh and Nrf2 in HNSCC in the context of therapeutic resistance and cancer stem cells (CSCs). We analyzed a cohort of patients with HNSCC to identify potential therapeutic biomarkers correlating with overall survival (OS) as well as disease-free survival (DFS) from our own data and validated these results using The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. Expression of Shh and Nrf2 was knocked down by siRNA and cell growth, sphere growth and chemotherapeutic resistance were evaluated. Widespread abundant expression of Shh and Nrf2 proteins were associated with shorter OS and DFS. The combination of Shh and Nrf2 expression levels was found to be a significant predictor of patient DFS. The tumor stromal index was correlated with Shh expression and inversely associated with shorter OS and DFS. Inhibition of Shh by siRNA or cyclopamine resulted in the attenuation of resistant CSC self-renewal, invasion, clonogenic growth and re-sensitization to the chemotherapeutic agents. Concomitant upregulation of Shh and Nrf2 proved to be an independent predictor of poor OS and DFS in patients with HNSCC. These findings suggest that Shh and Nrf2 could serve as therapeutic targets as well as promising dual prognostic therapeutic biomarkers for HNSCC."

        "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can infect animals, however, the whole range of potential hosts is still unknown. This work makes an assessment of wildlife susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing the similarities of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Protease, Serine 2 (TMPRSS2)\u2014both recognized as receptors and protease for coronavirus spike protein\u2014and the genetic variation of the viral protein spike in the recognition sites. The sequences from different mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, and the sequence from SARS-CoV-2 S protein were obtained from the GenBank. Comparisons of aligned sequences were made by selecting amino acids residues of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and S protein; phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the same sequences. The species susceptibility was ranked by substituting the values of amino acid residues for both proteins. Our results ranked primates at the top, but surprisingly, just below are carnivores, cetaceans and wild rodents, showing a relatively high potential risk, as opposed to lab rodents that are typically mammals at lower risk. Most of the sequences from birds, reptiles and amphibians occupied the lowest ranges in the analyses. Models and phylogenetic trees outputs showed the species that are more prone to getting infected with SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, during this short pandemic period, a high haplotypic variation was observed in the RBD of the viral S protein, suggesting new risks for other hosts. Our findings are consistent with other published results reporting laboratory and natural infections in different species. Finally, urgent measures of wildlife monitoring are needed regarding SARS-CoV-2, as well as measures for avoiding or limiting human contact with wildlife, and precautionary measures to protect wildlife workers and researchers; monitoring disposal of waste and sewage than can potentially affect the environment, and designing protocols for dealing with the outbreak."

We recorded a PRWHE score during the last week before surgery for 143 patients. They were contacted after 21 months and asked to furnish a new PRWHE of the state they were in during the last week before surgery. 80 (56%) of the patients responded. The mean difference was 10 (SD: 20; SEM: 2) higher remembered pre-operative score. The limits of 95% agreement for individual scores were -29 and 50, while the 95% confidence interval of the mean was 6-15. If 10 is subtracted from the mean remembered preoperative score of a group of patients, the real pre-operative score will with 95% confidence be this score plus/minus 4. Remembered pre-operative PRWHE scores are far too inaccurate to be of value in individual patients. It may be possible to predict the mean real pre-operative PRWHE score in groups of patients with useful accuracy using the remembered pre-operative score."

The aim of this study was to assess the post retentive potential of a self-adhesive resin cement using different adhesive systems to compare the push-out bond strengths of fiber posts. The post spaces of 56 mandibular premolar roots were prepared and divided into 4 experimental groups and further divided into 2 subgroups according to testing time (n=7). The fiber posts (Rely X Fiber Post) were luted with a self-adhesive resin cement (RelyX Unicem) and one of the following adhesive systems: no adhesive, a total-etch adhesive resin (Single Bond), a two-step self-etch adhesive resin (Clearfil SE Bond) and a one-step self-etch adhesive resin (Clearfil S3 Bond). Each root was cut horizontally, and 1.5 mm thick six root segments were prepared. Push-out tests were performed after one week or three months (0.5 mm/min). Statistical analysis were performed with three-way ANOVA (\u03b1=.05). Cervical root segments showed higher bond strength values than middle segments. Adhesive application increased the bond strength. For one week group, the total-etch adhesive resin Single Bond showed higher bond strength than the self-adhesive resin cement RelyX Unicem applied without adhesive resin at middle region. For 3 months group, the two-step self-etch adhesive resin Clearfil SE Bond showed the highest bond strength for both regions. Regarding the time considered, Clearfil SE Bond 3 months group showed higher bond strength values than one week group. Using the adhesive resins in combination with the self-adhesive resin cement improves the bond strengths. The bond strength values of two-step self-etch adhesive resin Clearfil SE Bond improved as time passes."

Excluding the sham group, SCI was established in rats by a clip compression injury and rats subsequently received HBO treatment for 2 weeks with or without an intraspinal injection of 0.1 U/\u00b5l ChABC. Neuromotor functions were examined using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor rating scale and the inclined plane assessment at baseline and for 4 weeks following SCI establishment. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were also measured, in addition to the expression of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) and aquaporin 4 (AQP4). Results revealed that combined HBO and ChABC treatment significantly improved neuromotor function compared with the HBO or ChABC treatments alone. HBO and/or ChABC treatment significantly increased SOD and decreased MDA levels, as well as GSK3\u03b2 expression, compared with the sham and SCI rats. The combined HBO and ChABC treatment significantly inhibited SCI-induced AQP4 expression, but ChABC alone did not. Functional recovery in the HBO + ChABC group was significantly increased compared with the HBO or ChABC groups. These results indicate that combined HBO and ChABC treatment is more effective in treating SCI than either therapy alone."

The LCZ's are mostly used to evaluate urban climate performance, particularly the relationship between the urban heat island effect (UHI) and the characteristics of the built-up environment. The World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) has provided a supervised LCZ classification method based only on moderate resolution free satellite imagery, mostly Landsat 7 or 8 (30\u00a0m pixel size, in the visible spectrum brands); however, its\u2019 results are less accurate for European cities. Conversely, alternative geographic information system (GIS)-based methods developed so far require information that is hardly available to all, such as building footprints or heights. Here, the ArcGIS based LCZ from Copernicus Toolbox (LCZC) provides an alternative classification method that uses only freely accessible information from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS), being possible to replicate it in 800 European urban locations. The method combines Urban Atlas (UA) and Corine Land Cover (CLC) with Tree Cover Density, Dominant Leaf Type and Grassland information, to produce a higher-resolution baseline shapefile that is classified according to each feature's dominant characteristics. The LCZC toolbox output is a LCZ raster map. It has been validated in five European cities: Athens, Barcelona, Lisbon, Marseille, and Naples. \u2022 The LCZC toolbox provides an alternative LCZ GIS-based classification, based on freely accessible CLMS datasets. \u2022 The use of CLMS shapefile higher-resolution inputs, particularly the UA and CLC datasets, ensures an output LCZ map that has greater detail and higher accuracy. \u2022 The availability of CLMS information in 800 European urban areas guarantees that the method can be replicated in those locations.

        "abstract": "Understanding how potent neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) inhibit SARS-CoV-2 is critical for effective therapeutic development. We previously described BD-368-2, a SARS-CoV-2 NAb with high potency; however, its neutralization mechanism is largely unknown. Here, we report the 3.5-\u00c5 cryo-EM structure of BD-368-2/trimeric-spike complex, revealing that BD-368-2 fully blocks ACE2 recognition by occupying all three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) simultaneously, regardless of their \u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown\u201d conformations. Also, BD-368-2 treats infected adult hamsters at low dosages and at various administering windows, in contrast to placebo hamsters that manifested severe interstitial pneumonia. Moreover, BD-368-2\u2019s epitope completely avoids the common binding site of VH3-53/VH3-66 recurrent NAbs, evidenced by tripartite co-crystal structures with RBDs. Pairing BD-368-2 with a potent recurrent NAb neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus at pM level and rescues mutation-induced neutralization escapes. Together, our results rationalized a new RBD epitope that leads to high neutralization potency and demonstrated BD-368-2\u2019s therapeutic potential in treating COVID-19. \u2022 BD-368-2 blocks all three ACE2 binding sites regardless of RBD spatial conformations \u2022 BD-368-2 treats severely infected hamsters at low dosages and various dose windows \u2022 New cocktail design based on BD-368-2 neutralizes escaping SARS-CoV-2 mutants BD-368-2 blocks all three ACE2 binding sites regardless of RBD spatial conformations BD-368-2 treats severely infected hamsters at low dosages and various dose windows New cocktail design based on BD-368-2 neutralizes escaping SARS-CoV-2 mutants Du et\u00a0al. showed how a potent COVID-19 antibody, BD-368-2, interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer to neutralize the virus and effectively treat severely infected hamsters. They further demonstrated how BD-368-2 can be paired with additional antibodies to form a cocktail that prevents the evolution of viral escape mutants."

We hypothesized that the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine is associated with the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators. Methods. Forty-eight rats were equally randomized into six groups (a control and five chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) groups) and given either saline or 10 mg/kg ketamine, respectively. The forced swimming test was performed, and the hippocampus was subsequently harvested for the determination of levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), kynurenine (KYN), and tryptophan (TRP). Results. CUMS induced depression-like behaviours and up-regulated the hippocampal levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IDO, and the KYN/TRP ratio, which were attenuated by a sub-anaesthetic dose of ketamine. Conclusion. CUMS-induced depression-like behaviours are associated with a reduction in hippocampal inflammatory mediators, whereas ketamine\u2019s antidepressant effect is associated with a down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the rat hippocampus."

In this study, we first identify and compare differentially expressed gene (DEG) signatures of ESC-derived cardiomyocyte differentiation (ESCDCD) in humans and mice. Then, the multiscale embedded gene co-expression network analysis (MEGENA) of the human ESCDCD dataset is performed to identify 212 significantly co-expressed gene modules, which capture well the regulatory information of cardiomyocyte differentiation. Three modules respectively involved in the regulation of stem cell pluripotency, Wnt, and calcium pathways are enriched in the DEG signatures of the differentiation phase transition in the two species. Three human-specific cardiomyocyte differentiation phase transition modules are identified. Moreover, the potential regulation mechanisms of transcription factors during cardiomyocyte differentiation are also illustrated. Finally, several novel key drivers of ESCDCD are identified with the evidence of their expression during mouse embryonic cardiomyocyte differentiation. Using an integrative network analysis, the core molecular signatures and gene subnetworks (modules) underlying cardiomyocyte lineage commitment are identified in both humans and mice. Our findings provide a global picture of gene-gene co-regulation and identify key regulators during ESCDCD. The article provides a strategy to compare the similarities and differences of core molecular signatures and modules based on a co-expression network during differentiation of human and mouse embryonic stem cells toward cardiomyocytes. The driver genes and the potential regulation of transcription factor are further illustrated in the sequential differentiation process"

Applying the trial findings to patients typically seen in clinical practice, such as those with established CV disease and those with multiple CV risk factors without established CV disease, requires further clarity. To bridge this gap in our current knowledge, the aim of this review was to utilise expert-driven opinions on common case scenarios and practical recommendations on the most appropriate choice of agents, according to an individual patient\u2019s clinical risk profile (CV and kidney disease), treatment preference and reimbursement environment from an Australian perspective.

This study sought to examine the impact of long\u2010term burden of body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure (BP) levels on changes in adult left ventricular (LV) structure and function in a community\u2010based cohort. The longitudinal study cohort consisted of 1108 adult patients (726 White; 41.9% men; mean age, 48.2\u00a0years in the last survey) who had been examined 4 to 16 times for BMI and BP and echocardiographic LV structure and function in adulthood, with a mean follow\u2010up period of 38.8\u00a0years. The area under the curve was used as a measure of long\u2010term burden of BMI and BP. Adult LV mass index was significantly associated with childhood and adulthood BMI and systolic BP (SBP), and their area under the curve values (\u03b2=0.07\u20130.37; P <0.05 for all). Adult LV ejection fraction was negatively associated with childhood BMI (\u03b2=\u22120.08), adult BMI (\u03b2=\u22120.07) and BMI area under the curve (\u03b2=\u22120.07) ( P <0.05 for all); the effects of SBP measures were not significant. Adult E/A ratio was negatively associated with adulthood SBP (\u03b2=\u22120.13; P <0.01) and total area under the curve of SBP (\u03b2=\u22120.13; P <0.01). E/e\u2032 ratio was positively associated with BMI and SBP measures. The effects of diastolic BP measures were substantially similar to those of SBP measures. Participants with LV hypertrophy, eccentric hypertrophy, and concentric hypertrophy had significantly lower LV ejection fraction and higher E/e\u2032 ratio. These observations provide strong evidence that early\u2010life adiposity and BP levels and their life\u2010course cumulative burdens are associated with subclinical changes in adult LV structure and function in the general population."

Our study aimed to assess the addiction levels and profiles of university students in Lebanon, and thus to evaluate the rapid rising in dependence regarding smoking, alcohol, and illegal drug use during this crisis. This cross-sectional study was carried out between February and September 2020. A total of 467 participants (315 females, 152 males; Mage = 23.48 \u00b1 6.03) were recruited through convenience sampling through several universities in Lebanon\u2019s governorates. Participants received the online link to the survey. Students were divided into three clusters as follows: cluster 1, which corresponds to students with moderate addictions; cluster 2, which corresponds to students with high addictions; and cluster 3, which corresponds to students with low addictions. When comparing cluster 1 to cluster 3, the results of the multinomial regression showed that older age (aOR=1.08) and having a high monthly income compared to no income (aOR=2.78) were significantly associated with higher odds of being in cluster 1 compared to cluster 3. When comparing cluster 2 to cluster 3, the results of the multinomial regression showed that female gender (aOR=0.19) was significantly associated with lower odds of being in cluster 2 compared to cluster 3, whereas having a dead (aOR=16.38) or divorced parent (aOR=6.54) and having a low (aOR=3.93) or intermediate income compared to zero income (aOR=4.71) were significantly associated with higher odds of being in cluster 2 compared to cluster 3. The results of our study revealed a considerable prevalence of addiction to alcohol, illicit drugs, and specially to smoking, among Lebanese university students. These findings emphasize the need to implement firm policies and rules in an attempt to minimize the tendency of the young population to engage in such addictions."

        "abstract": "Tumor cells able to recapitulate tumor heterogeneity have been tracked, isolated and characterized in different tumor types, and are commonly named Cancer Stem Cells or Cancer Initiating Cells (CSC/CIC). CSC/CIC are disseminated in the tumor mass and are resistant to anti-cancer therapies and adverse conditions. They are able to divide into another stem cell and a \u201cproliferating\u201d cancer cell. They appear to be responsible for disease recurrence and metastatic dissemination even after apparent eradication of the primary tumor. The modulation of CSC/CIC activities by the tumor microenvironment (TUMIC) is still poorly known. CSC/CIC may mutually interact with the TUMIC in a special and unique manner depending on the TUMIC cells or proteins encountered. The TUMIC consists of extracellular matrix components as well as cellular players among which endothelial, stromal and immune cells, providing and responding to signals to/from the CSC/CIC. This interplay can contribute to the mechanisms through which CSC/CIC may reside in a dormant state in a tissue for years, later giving rise to tumor recurrence or metastasis in patients. Different TUMIC components, including the connective tissue, can differentially activate CIC/CSC in different areas of a tumor and contribute to the generation of cancer heterogeneity. Here, we review possible networking activities between the different components of the tumor microenvironment and CSC/CIC, with a focus on its role in tumor heterogeneity and progression. We also summarize novel therapeutic options that could target both CSC/CIC and the microenvironment to elude resistance mechanisms activated by CSC/CIC, responsible for disease recurrence and metastases."

From this point source, Francisella tularensis \u2013infected prairie dogs were traced to animals distributed to the Czech Republic and to a Texas pet shop. F. tularensis culture isolates were recovered tissue specimens from 63 prairie dogs, including one each from the secondary distribution sites. Molecular and biochemical subtyping indicated that all isolates were F. tularensis subsp. holarctica (Type B). Microagglutination assays detected antibodies against F. tularensis, with titers as great as 1:4,096 in some live animals. All seropositive animals remained culture positive, suggesting that prairie dogs may act as chronic carriers of F. tularensis . These findings demonstrate the need for additional studies of tularemia in prairie dogs, given the seriousness of the resulting disease, the fact that prairie dogs are sold commercially as pets, and the risk for pet-to-human transmission."

This study evaluates long-term (10-year) outcome in patients with CRC randomly assigned to adjuvant 5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin (5FU+LV) or 5-FU/Levamisole (5FU+LEV). Methods: Between 1990 and 1995, 398 patients with curatively resected Stage II-III CRC were randomly assigned to adjuvant 5FU+LV or 5FU+LEV for 12 months. Results: No difference was evident in 10-year relapse-free or overall survival between study groups. Grade III toxicity was similar between groups; however, neurotoxicity was significantly greater with 5FU+LEV (p=0.02) and gastrointestinal toxicity with 5FU+LV (p=0.03). Female patients treated with 5FU+LEV had improved overall survival. Conclusions: Adjuvant treatment of CRC is still based on leucovorin modulated fluorouracil. The long-term follow-up results of this trial indicate that the adjuvant treatment of Stage II-III CRC with 5FU+LV or 5FU+LEV is equally effective. The finding of improved survival in female subjects treated with 5FU+LEV warrants further study to determine if Levamisole is a better modulator of 5-FU than Leucovorin in this patient subset."

DNA methylation is a key mechanism for regulating gene expression in response to environmental changes. We carried out comparative genomic analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in the blood samples of two different thoroughbred horses before and after exercise by methylated-DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-Seq). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the pre-and post-exercise blood samples of superior and inferior horses were identified. Exercise altered the methylation patterns. After 30 min of exercise, 596 genes were hypomethylated and 715 genes were hypermethylated in the superior horse, whereas in the inferior horse, 868 genes were hypomethylated and 794 genes were hypermethylated. These genes were analyzed based on gene ontology (GO) annotations and the exercise-related pathway patterns in the two horses were compared. After exercise, gene regions related to cell division and adhesion were hypermethylated in the superior horse, whereas regions related to cell signaling and transport were hypermethylated in the inferior horse. Analysis of the distribution of methylated CpG islands confirmed the hypomethylation in the gene-body methylation regions after exercise. The methylation patterns of transposable elements also changed after exercise. Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) showed abundance of DMRs. Collectively, our results serve as a basis to study exercise-based reprogramming of epigenetic traits."

The most contagious form of COVID-19 associated with ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 majorly produces the cytokine storm and severe lung inflammation and ultimately leads to respiratory failure. ARDS is a complex disease and there is no proper therapeutics for effective therapy. Still, there is a huge scope to identify novel targets to combat respiratory illness. In the current study, we have identified the epigenetic regulating protein BRD4 and developed siRNA based nanomedicine to treat the ARDS. The liposomes were prepared by thin-film hydration method, where BRD4 siRNA complexed with cationic lipid and exhibited 96.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.01\u00a0nm size and stable even in the presence of RNase. BRD4 siRNA lipoplexes (BRD4-siRNA-LP) inhibited inflammatory cells in lungs and suppressed the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced the neutrophil infiltration and mast cell accumulation. Also, BRD4 siRNA based nanomedicine significantly reduced the LPS induced cytokine storm followed by inflammatory signaling pathways. Interestingly, BRD4-siRNA-LP suppressed the LPS-induced p65 and STAT3 nuclear translocation and ameliorated the lung inflammation. Thus, BRD4-siRNA-LP could be a plausible therapeutic option for treating ARDS and might be useful for combating the COVID-19 associated respiratory illness."

The toxins of all known TA systems are proteins while the antitoxins are either proteins or non-coding RNAs. Based on the molecular nature of the antitoxin and its mode of interaction with the toxin the TA modules are currently grouped into five classes. In general, the toxin is more stable than the antitoxin but the latter is expressed to a higher level. If supply of the antitoxin stops, for instance under special growth conditions or by plasmid loss in case of plasmid encoded TA systems, the antitoxin is rapidly degraded and can no longer counteract the toxin. Consequently, the toxin becomes activated and can act on its cellular targets. Typically, TA toxins act on crucial cellular processes including translation, replication, cytoskeleton formation, membrane integrity, and cell wall biosynthesis. TA systems and their components are also versatile tools for a multitude of purposes in basic research and biotechnology. Currently, TA systems are frequently used for selection in cloning and for single protein expression in living bacterial cells. Since several TA toxins exhibit activity in yeast and mammalian cells they may be useful for applications in eukaryotic systems. TA modules are also considered as promising targets for the development of antibacterial drugs and their potential to combat viral infection may aid in controlling infectious diseases."

An undifferentiated gonad consisting of germ cells and somatic cells was found to form at a caudal site in the space between the internal yolk sacks of cuttlefish embryos at 14 and 21 days after spawning (DAS). Sexual dimorphism in the gonad was first detected at around 28 DAS. Meiotic oocytes were observed as the first visible morphological characteristic of ovaries in the gonads of some cuttlefish embryos at 28 DAS. In other individuals, neither meiotic germ cells, nor the appearance of a testicular structure, were observed in the gonad even after 10 days post hatching (DPH). Seminiferous tubules, consisting of a small number of spermatogonia and a surrounding basement membrane, were the first visible morphological characteristic of the testis in the male gonad, detected at around 20 DPH. This is the third report on the gonadal sex differentiation process in cephalopods."

        "abstract": "Protein oxidation is involved in regulatory physiological events as well as in damage to tissues and is thought to play a key role in the pathophysiology of diseases and in the aging process. Protein-bound carbonyls represent a marker of global protein oxidation, as they are generated by multiple different reactive oxygen species in blood, tissues and cells. Sample preparation and stabilization are key steps in the accurate quantification of oxidation-related products and examination of physiological/pathological processes. This review therefore focuses on the sample preparation processes used in the most relevant methods to detect protein carbonyls after derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine with an emphasis on measurement in plasma, cells, organ homogenates, isolated proteins and organelles. Sample preparation, derivatization conditions and protein handling are presented for the spectrophotometric and HPLC method as well as for immunoblotting and ELISA. An extensive overview covering these methods in previously published articles is given for researchers who plan to measure protein carbonyls in different samples. \u2022 Derivatizing protein carbonyls with dinitrophenylhydrazine is very common. \u2022 For the measurement of protein carbonyls in plasma, cells, organ homogenates and isolated proteins are a wide variety of sample preparation and handling protocolls used. \u2022 ELISA seems best-suited for high-throughput clinical studies. \u2022 Immunoblotting is especially applicable in cell culture studies. \u2022 Existing protocols must be further improved and standardized.

        "abstract": "Although the number of emergency managers has risen in South Korea (hereafter referred to as Korea) over the years, their role is not yet as defined and noteworthy compared to other professions because of its unidisciplinary approach. This article investigates how Korea has to improve emergency managers' disciplinary approach to ultimately contribute to the goal of effective transnational disaster management. This study uses qualitative content analysis of government policies, college curricula, nongovernmental organizations' (NGOs') emergency-manager certification, and mass media coverage to compare emergency managers' unidisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches. The key tenet is that Korea must change its emergency managers' unidisciplinary approach into a multidisciplinary approach because the former is less effective when dealing with complicated disaster management systems. To achieve this change, the stakeholders must carry out their assigned responsibilities under risk-oriented management. As for the study's international implications, developing nations may consider the enhancement of related educational curricula, collaborative learning, continuous evaluation, disaster awareness, and disaster prevention for the emergency managers' multidisciplinary approach."

        "abstract": "Women living with HIV (WLWH) are at higher risk of acquisition and progression of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Evidence on effect of HPV vaccination in this population is limited. This phase IV randomized controlled observer-blind study assessed immunogenicity and safety of two HPV vaccines (AS04-HPV-16/18\u202fvs. 4vHPV) given in WLWH (stage 1) and HIV- females aged 15\u201325 years. Co-primary endpoints were to demonstrate, in WLWH subjects, non-inferiority (and if demonstrated, superiority) of AS04-HPV-16/18\u202fvs. 4vHPV for HPV-16 and HPV-18 by pseudovirion-based neutralization assay (PBNA) at month 7 and safety. Non-inferiority criteria was lower limit (LL) of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the GMT ratio AS04-HPV-16/18/4vHPV above 0.5, in the according to protocol population. NCT01031069 Among 873 subjects recruited between 26-Oct-2010 and 14-May-2015, 546 were randomized (1:1) and received at least one vaccine dose (total vaccinated cohort, TVC): 257 were WLWH (129 AS04-HPV-16/18; 128 4vHPV) and 289 were subjects without HIV (144 AS04-HPV-16/18; 145 4vHPV). Baseline CD4 cell count in WLWH was at least 350 cells/mm 3 . At month 7, AS04-HPV-16/18 showed immunological superiority to 4vHPV in WLWH. Neutralizing anti-HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody GMTs were 2\u00b774 (95% CI: 1\u00b783; 4\u00b711) and 7\u00b744 (95% CI: 4\u00b779; 11\u00b754) fold higher in AS04-HPV-16/18\u202fvs. 4vHPV (LL of the GMT ratio >1 in TVC, p <0\u00b70001), respectively. Similar results were observed by ELISA up to month 24. Solicited local and general symptoms were in line with product labels. The number of reported serious adverse events (SAEs) was balanced throughout the study. Both vaccines showed an acceptable safety profile in all subjects. Despite the absence of an immunological correlate of protection for HPV, differences in immune responses elicited by the vaccines especially for HPV-18 may translate into longer lasting or more robust protection against cervical cancer with the AS04-HPV-16/18 vaccine in WLWH. 10.13039/100004330 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A. funded this study (NCT01031069) and related publications. www.clinicaltrials.gov - NCT01031069"

Furthermore, Notch signaling can repair myocardial injury by promoting myocardial regeneration, protecting ischemic myocardium, inducing angiogenesis, and negatively regulating cardiac fibroblast-myofibroblast transformation. This review provides an update on the known roles of Notch signaling in the mammalian heart. The goal is to assist in developing strategies to influence Notch signaling and optimize myocardial injury repair."

This study aimed to assess the haemodynamic characteristics of patients with HFrEF in response to non\u2010invasive preload stress during dynamic postural alterations achieved by combining both semi\u2010sitting position and passive leg\u2010lifting and to evaluate whether combined postural stress could be used for risk stratification in these patients. For this study, 101 patients with HFrEF and 35 age\u2010matched and sex\u2010matched healthy controls were prospectively recruited. After all standard echocardiographic measurements were obtained in the left decubitus position, all subjects underwent postural stress testing, which consisted of changing from semi\u2010sitting position to passive leg\u2010lifting. During a median follow\u2010up period of 12.2\u00a0months, 21 (21%) patients developed adverse cardiovascular events.

        "title": "Vegetarian Diets: Planetary Health and Its Alignment with Human Health",
        "abstract": "To maintain planetary health, human activities must limit the use of Earth's resources within finite boundaries and avoid environmental degradation. At present, food systems account for a substantial use of natural resources and contribute considerably to climate change, degradation of land, water use, and other impacts, which in turn threaten human health through food insecurity. Additionally, current dietary patterns, rich in animal products and excessive in calories, are detrimental to both population and planetary health. In order to resolve the diet-environment-health trilemma, population-level dietary changes are essential. Vegetarian diets are reported to be healthy options. Most plant-sourced foods are less resource intense and taxing on the environment than the production of animal-derived foods, particularly meat and dairy from ruminants. This review article explores simultaneously the environmental sustainability of vegetarian diets, and its alignment with people's health. In general, the progression from omnivorous to ovolactovegetarian and vegan diets is associated with increased environmental sustainability. Greenhouse gas emissions resulting from vegan and ovolactovegetarian diets are \u223c50% and \u223c35% lower, respectively, than most current omnivore diets, and with corresponding reductions in the use of natural resources. Concomitant health benefits could be obtained by shifting from current dietary patterns to sustainable vegetarian diets. Thus, there seems to be an alignment of health and environmental outcomes for vegetarian diets. Although this shows the human health and environmental sustainability benefits of vegetarian diets in high-income countries, questions remain about the challenges in other contexts and the political will to promote meat-free diets as the social norm."

        "abstract": "Chronic periodontitis, a common oral disease, usually results in irreversible bone resorption. Bone regeneration is a complex process between bone-forming activity of osteoblasts and bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts, and still remains a challenge for physicians clinically. A previous study demonstrated that the mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling pathway is involved in osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells. Herein, whether rapamycin could be used to induce osteogenic differentiation of primary bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in vitro and promote new bone formation in vivo were evaluated. The results demonstrated that rapamycin alone was not enough to fully induce osteoblast differentiation in vitro and enhanced bone regeneration in vivo . Interestingly, rapamycin in rapamycin plus lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated BMSCs significantly increased the gene expression levels of Sp7 transcription factor, runt related transcription factor 2, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and collagen I (Col I), ALP activity, and calcium nodule at different time points in vitro , indicating that osteoblast differentiation occurs by rapamycin when BMSCs are exposed to LPS simultaneously. It was also demonstrated that rapamycin in rapamycin plus LPS-treated rats promoted bone regeneration in vivo . These results suggest that rapamycin may influence osteoblast differentiation and new bone formation after LPS induces an inflammatory environment. Rapamycin may be used to treat periodontitis associated with bone loss in future clinical practice."

Therefore, we explored in vivo HER3 tumor status assessment after lapatinib treatment with zirconium-89 ( 89 Zr)-labeled anti-HER3 antibody mAb3481 positron emission tomography (PET). Lapatinib effects on HER3 cell surface expression and mAb3481 internalization were evaluated in human breast (BT474, SKBR3) and gastric (N87) cancer cell lines using flow cytometry. Next, in vivo effects of daily lapatinib treatment on 89 Zr-mAb3481 BT474 and N87 xenograft tumor uptake were studied. PET-scans (BT474 only) were made after daily lapatinib treatment for 9\u00a0days, starting 3\u00a0days prior to 89 Zr-mAb3481 administration. Subsequently, ex vivo  89 Zr-mAb3481 organ distribution analysis was performed and HER3 tumor levels were measured with Western blot and immunohistochemistry. In vitro , lapatinib increased membranous HER3 in BT474, SKBR3 and N87 cells, and consequently mAb3481 internalization 1.7-fold (BT474), 1.4-fold (SKBR3) and 1.4-fold (N87). 89 Zr-mAb3481 BT474 tumor uptake was remarkably high at SUV mean 5.6\u00b10.6 (51.8\u00b17.7%ID/g) using a 10\u00a0\u03bcg 89 Zr-mAb3481 protein dose in vehicle-treated mice. However, compared to vehicle, lapatinib did not affect 89 Zr-mAb3481 ex vivo uptake in BT474 and N87 tumors, while HER3 tumor expression remained unchanged. In conclusion, lapatinib increased in vitro HER3 tumor cell expression, but not when these cells were xenografted. 89 Zr-mAb3481 PET accurately reflected HER3 tumor status. 89 Zr-mAb3481 PET showed high, HER3-specific tumor uptake, and such an approach might sensitively assess HER3 tumor heterogeneity and treatment response in patients."

The eCB system also has an important role in reward mechanisms, and nicotine addiction has been associated with aberrant reward processing. Motivated by this evidence, we tested the hypothesis that eCB modulation of reward processing is altered in subjects with a nicotine addiction (NAD). For this purpose, we compared reward-related activity in NAD with healthy controls (HC) in a pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study using \u0394 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) administration to challenge the eCB system. Eleven HC and 10 NAD participated in a 3-T functional MRI (fMRI) study with a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled design, using a Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) paradigm with three reward levels. Reward activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and caudate putamen during anticipation and feedback of reward was compared after THC and placebo. fMRI results indicated a significant reduction of reward anticipation activity in the NAcc in NAD after THC administration, which was not present in HC. This is indicated by a significant group by drug by reward interaction. Our data show that THC significantly reduces the NAcc response to monetary reward anticipation in NAD. These results suggest that nicotine addiction is associated with altered eCB modulation of reward processing in the NAcc. This study adds important human data to existing evidence implicating the eCB system in nicotine addiction."

Fresh fecal samples were diluted, and after cultivating bacteria for 48 hours at 37\u00b0C, we compared the number of bacterial cells in gut flora per gram of feces and determined gut colonization resistance. The abundance of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus in feces was significantly higher in the diarrhea group than in the healthy control group. Conversely, the abundance of Bifidobacterium and lactic acid bacteria was significantly lower in the diarrhea group than in the healthy control group. Serum interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 levels in the diarrhea group were significantly higher than those in the healthy control group. Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis revealed that serum IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, and TNF-\u03b1 levels positively correlated with abundance of E. coli and Enterococcus and negatively correlated with abundance of Bifidobacterium and lactic acid bacteria. Gut dysbacteriosis and overexpression of serum inflammatory factors occur in children with noninfectious diarrhea and are closely correlated."

        "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes during multiple processes in cancer. It has been observed that miR-27b may act as a tumor-suppressor and was significantly downregulated in a number of types of cancer. However, the functions of miR-27b in gastric cancer (GC) remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the functional role of miR-27b in the progression of GC. The downregulation of miR-27b in human GC plasma was confirmed using miRNA microarray and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses. The association between circulating miR-27b expression and clinicopathological features of GC was analyzed and the results demonstrated that the level of circulating miR-27b was significantly correlated with GC differentiation. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified that the plasma level of miR-27b may be a potential biomarker for differentiating patients with GC from healthy controls. In order to investigate the effect of miR-27b on GC cell behavior, miR-27b was overexpressed using miR-27b mimics, and it was observed that miR-27b was able to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in SGC7901 cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC) is a target of miR-27b, and the results of the present study were consistent with these reports. Taken together, the results of the present study indicated that miR-27b may act as a potential biomarker for differentiating patients with GC from healthy controls, and serve as a tumor suppressor in GC by targeting VEGFC."

        "abstract": "Strokes are devastating as there are no current therapies to prevent long-term neurological deficits. Previous studies reported that cerebroprotein hydrolysate (CH) plays a role in neuronal protection in acute phase after ischemic stroke, while the long-term effects of CH upon brain plasticity and neurological outcomes after stroke are still uncertain. To address these gaps, we assessed the effect of a new cerebroprotein hydrolysate, CH1, on long-term gray and white matter integrity as well as axonal plasticity in the late phase after ischemic stroke and the potential mechanisms. Adult male mice were subjected to permanent distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO), followed by daily intraperitoneal injection of CH1 for 14 days. Motor function was measured weekly through behavioral neurological evaluations. Gray matter intensity and white matter intensity were examined by immunofluorescence staining. The sonic hedgehog (Shh) inhibitor cyclopamine (CYC) was injected to determine the involvement of the Shh pathway in the therapeutic effects of CH1. We found that intraperitoneal delivery of CH1, compared to vehicle administration, significantly improved long-term neurological outcomes at various times and promoted neuronal viability at 14 days but not at 28 days after stroke. Importantly, CH1 mitigated stroke-induced white matter injury and facilitated axonal plasticity in the late stage after stroke. These results unveil a previously unappreciated role for CH in the repair of white matter and brain plasticity after stroke."

A retrospective chart review was conducted to identify patients who met the inclusion criteria for treatment-resistant depression and bipolar depression according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition, Text Revision criteria, and these patients received rapid infusion of esketamine between June 2012 and December 2015. The Montgomery\u2013\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was administered to measure and score depressive symptom severity before infusion and at 24 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days after infusion. In addition, Clinical Global Impression scale was administered before and 7 days after esketamine infusion. Esketamine was administered to 30 patients. A total of 27 patients met the inclusion criteria and had MADRS evaluation data, which showed that 23 had unipolar and 4 had bipolar depression. Thirteen patients (48.1%) showed therapeutic response (MADRS reduction \u226550%) within 1 week (7 days) of intervention. Remission (MADRS <7) was observed in 10 patients (37.0%) in the same period. Therapeutic response and remission frequencies were seen in 16 (59.3%) and 11 (40.7%) patients, respectively, within 24 hours following drug infusion. The most relevant side effect observed during the esketamine infusion was dissociative symptoms ranging from mild to severe, which was reported by 11.1% of patients as a very disturbing experience. This study was done retrospectively, had a small sample size, and there was no comparative group. The present study demonstrates that rapid infusion of esketamine is possibly not the optimal choice to administer this drug for treatment-resistant depression due to tolerability reasons. Further controlled studies are required to investigate efficacy, safety, and tolerability profiles among the different types of ketamines and methods of using this drug in depressed patients."

        "abstract": "microRNAs have been reported to play critical roles in cancer and to have potential as diagnostic biomarkers. During miRNA biogenesis, one strand of the miRNA hairpin precursor is preferentially selected as a functionally mature miRNA, while the other strand is typically degraded. Arm switching occurs when the strand preference is changed. This preference can be different and can change dynamically depending upon the species, tissue types, or development stages. Due to recent advances in next-generation sequencing methods, arm switching has been observed in a variety of cancers. A tumour miRNA-Seq dataset was collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The support vector machine (SVM) method combined with 5-fold cross validation was applied to select the best combination of arm-switched miRNA tumour markers. Survival analysis was also applied to identify patient survival associated miRNA markers. We observed 51 arm-switched miRNAs and of these, 7 were associated with patient survival. Twenty-three 1-combination arm switching miRNAs with excellent diagnostic value were identified. Interestingly, ovarian cancer showed a significant difference in arm switching pattern compared with 32 other cancers. These results suggest that arm switching miRNAs could be used as potential biomarkers for various cancers.

However, the exact mechanisms that underlie palmitate-induced pancreatic \u03b2-cell apoptosis and through which pathway Bcl-2 executes the protective effect are still unclear. A stable Bcl-2-overexpressing RINm5F cell clone (BMG) and its negative control (B45) were exposed to palmitate for up to 8 h, and cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8m), reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and NF-\u03baB activation were studied in time course experiments. Palmitate exposure for 8 h resulted in increased cell death rates, and this event was partially counteracted by Bcl-2. Bcl-2 overexpression promoted in parallel also a delayed induction of GADD153/CHOP and a weaker phosphorylation of BimEL in palmitate-exposed cells. At earlier time points (2\u20134 h) palmitate exposure resulted in increased generation of ROS, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8m), and a modest increase in the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and IRE1\u03b1. BMG cells produced similar amounts of ROS and displayed the same eIF2\u03b1 and IRE1\u03b1 phosphorylation rates as B45 cells. However, the palmitate-induced dissipation of \u0394\u03c8m was partially counteracted by Bcl-2. In addition, basal NF-\u03baB activity was increased in BMG cells. Our results indicate that Bcl-2 counteracts palmitate-induced \u03b2-cell death by maintaining mitochondrial membrane integrity and augmenting NF-\u03baB activity, but not by affecting ROS production and ER stress."

Genotoxic stress not only generates free radicals, but also affects actin cytoskeleton stability. We showed that Dox-induced RhoA signaling stimulated actin cytoskeleton alterations, resulting in central stress fiber disruption at early time points and cell periphery cortical actin formation at a later stage, in HeLa cells. Interestingly, activation of a cofilin phosphatase, chronophin (CIN), was initially evoked by Dox-induced RhoA signaling, resulting in a rapid phosphorylated cofilin turnover leading to actin cytoskeleton remodeling. In addition, a novel interaction between CIN and 14-3-3\u03b6 was detected in the absence of Dox treatment. We demonstrated that CIN activity is quite contrary to 14-3-3\u03b6 binding, and the interaction leads to enhanced phosphorylated cofilin levels. Therefore, initial CIN activation regulation could be critical in Dox-induced actin cytoskeleton remodeling through RhoA/cofilin signaling."

No reactivation of PPO was found during storage in any plasma treated sample. Cold plasma improved color of the juice after longest treatments. Antioxidant capacity of the juice was increased after cold plasma treatments. Direct cold plasma treatment has been investigated as an alternative non-thermal technology as a means of maintaining and improving quality of fresh cloudy apple juice. Process variables studied included type of plasma discharge, input voltage and treatment time on polyphenol oxidase (PPO) inactivation. Spark discharge plasma at 10.5\u202fkV for 5\u202fmin was the best treatment, with near total inactivation of PPO achieved, although good PPO inactivation was also recorded using shorter treatment times. Residual activity (RA) of PPO was 16 and 27.6% after 5 and 4\u202fmin of treatment respectively. This PPO inactivation was maintained throughout the storage trials, but decreased with samples treated for a shorter time. Plasma treatment improved key quality parameters of Golden delicious cloudy apple juice, with retention of critical quality parameters during extended storage trials. Color was the most noticeable change, which was enhanced with retention of a greener color. An increase of 69 and 64% was obtained in the total phenolic content after 4 and 5\u202fmin of treatment, respectively. Therefore, cold plasma was demonstrated to be a good alternative to traditional heat treatments for enhanced quality retention of fresh cloudy apple juice and over its storage."

        "abstract": "Since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has become more potent and better tolerated. While the current treatment regimens still have limitations, they are more effective, more convenient, and less toxic than regimens used in the early HAART era, and new agents, formulations and strategies continue to be developed. Simplification of therapy is an option for many patients currently being treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The main goals are to reduce pill burden, improve quality of life and enhance medication adherence, while minimizing short- and long-term toxicities, reducing the risk of virologic failure and maximizing cost-effectiveness. ART simplification strategies that are currently used or are under study include the use of once-daily regimens, less toxic drugs, fixed-dose coformulations and induction-maintenance approaches. Improved adherence and persistence have been observed with the adoption of some of these strategies. The role of regimen simplification has implications not only for individual patients, but also for health care policy. With increased interest in ART regimen simplification, it is critical to study not only implications for individual tolerability, toxicity, adherence, persistence and virologic efficacy, but also cost, scalability, and potential for dissemination and implementation, such that limited human and financial resources are optimally allocated for maximal efficiency, coverage and sustainability of global HIV/AIDS treatment.

We assessed school teachers\u2019 knowledge of the effects of smoking and attitudes towards smoking. Of the 152 schools in the Kingdom of Bahrain with a total of 3360 teachers, a random sample of 49 schools was selected. A questionnaire was distributed to all teachers working in these schools to collect information about their smoking habits and their knowledge of smoking-related health issues. The prevalence of smoking amongst Bahraini school teachers is low (7%). The majority of smokers were males (94%). Only 3.07% of the sample population were ex-smokers. In general the teachers had good knowledge of the effects of smoking on health, but some 9.5% had wrong concepts, believing that smoking does not have any harmful effect. School teachers are a main source of health information for students. Therefore, any anti-smoking campaign should involve continuous teacher training to increase their awareness of the hazards of smoking."

Increased expression level of Erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (ERBB3) has previously been demonstrated to be associated with the occurrence of cervical cancer; however, the functionality of ERBB3 in the development of cervical cancer remains incompletely understood. In the present study, the expression level of ERBB3 in patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma and cervical adenocarcinoma was detected by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The effects of ERBB3 small interfering RNA silencing on cell proliferation, migration and invasion were explored, and the interaction between ERBB3 and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 4 (MTK-1) was also investigated. It was identified that the downregulation of ERBB3 significantly decreased the proliferative, migratory and invasive abilities of cervical cancer cells. In addition, the expression level of MTK-1 was also significantly decreased following MTK-1 siRNA silencing. Therefore, we hypothesize that the downregulation of ERBB3 may decrease the proliferative, migratory and invasive abilities of cervical cancer cells by inhibiting the expression of MTK-1."

        "abstract": "For decades, moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) has been the cornerstone of exercise prescription for cardiac rehabilitation (CR). High intensity interval training (HIIT) is now recognized in CR exercise guidelines as an appropriate and efficient modality for improving cardiorespiratory fitness, a strong predictor of mortality. However, the clinical application of HIIT in a real world CR setting, in terms of feasibility, safety, and long-term adherence, needs further investigation to address ongoing reservations. Furthermore, studies using objective measures of exercise intensity (such as heart rate; HR) have produced variable outcomes. Therefore we propose investigating the use of subjective measures (such as rating of perceived exertion (RPE)) for prescribing exercise intensity. One hundred adults with coronary artery disease (CAD) attending a hospital-initiated CR program will be randomized to 1) HIIT: 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0min high intensity intervals at 15\u201318 RPE interspersed with 3-min active recovery periods or 2) MICT: usual care exercise including 40\u00a0min continuous exercise at a moderate intensity corresponding to 11\u201313 RPE. Primary outcome is change in exercise capacity (peak VO 2 ) following 4 weeks of exercise training. Secondary outcome measures are: feasibility, safety, exercise adherence, body composition, vascular function, inflammatory markers, intrahepatic lipid, energy intake, and dietary behavior over 12-months; and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) following 12 weeks of exercise training. This study aims to address the ongoing concerns regarding the practicality and safety of HIIT in CR programs. We anticipate study findings will lead to the development of a standardized protocol to facilitate CR programs to incorporate HIIT as a standard exercise option for appropriate patients."

We aimed to evaluate risk factors contributing to hypovitaminosis D among nondiabetic renal transplant recipients (RTR) with serum creatinine <2.0 mg/dL, at least 6 months after transplantation. One hundred RTR were subjected to anthropometric evaluation and body composition assessment through bioelectrical impedance analysis; blood samples were drawn for biochemical and hormonal determinations and clinical data were retrieved from the medical records. Hypovitaminosis D was observed in 65% and overweight (body mass index, BMI >25 kg/m 2 ) in 59% of cases with a significant median weight gain after transplantation of 5.1 kg. An inadequate distribution of body fat was evidenced in 50% of males and in 58% of females. Patients with either vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency presented significantly higher median values of body fat and weight gain since transplantation, as well as lower lean mass compared with patients with normal vitamin D levels (P < 0.001). Moreover, median values of waist circumference, BMI, serum leptin and parathyroid hormone levels were significantly higher in the group with vitamin D deficiency. A multivariate linear regression analysis then revealed that body fat and leptin levels, but not skin color, gender, age, glucocorticoid use, renal function, microalbuminuria and other confounding factors, were independently associated with low levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D3 even after adjustments for seasonal variations. In conclusion, the present study showed body fat and serum leptin levels to be the only independent risk factors for hypovitaminosis D among RTR."

        "abstract": "Several publications suggest an association between certain types of insulin and cancer, but with conflicting results. We investigated whether insulin glargine (A21Gly,B31Arg,B32Arg human insulin) is associated with an increased risk of cancer in a large population-based cohort study. Data for this study were obtained from dispensing records from community pharmacies individually linked to hospital discharge records from 2.5\u00a0million individuals in the Netherlands. In a cohort of incident users of insulin, the association between insulin glargine and other insulin analogues, respectively, and cancer was analysed in comparison with human insulin using Cox proportional hazard models with cumulative duration of drug use as a time-varying determinant. The first hospital admission with a primary diagnosis of cancer was considered as the main outcome; secondary analyses were performed with specific cancers as outcomes. Of the 19,337 incident insulin users enrolled, 878 developed cancer. Use of insulin glargine was associated with a lower risk of malignancies in general in comparison with human insulin (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.71, 0.80). In contrast, an increased risk was found for breast cancer (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.22, 2.05). Dose\u2013response relationships could not be identified. Users of insulin glargine and users of other insulin analogues had a lower risk of cancer in general than those using human insulin. Both associations might be a consequence of residual confounding, lack of adherence or competing risk. However, as in previous studies, we demonstrated an increased risk of breast cancer in users of insulin glargine in comparison with users of human insulin.

        "abstract": "The modulation of the toxic effects of 2-aminoanthracene (2AA) on the liver by apoptosis was investigated. Fisher-344 (F344) rats were exposed to various concentrations of 2AA for 14 and 28 days. The arylamine 2AA is an aromatic hydrocarbon employed in manufacturing chemicals, dyes, inks, and it is also a curing agent in epoxy resins and polyurethanes. 2AA has been detected in tobacco smoke and cooked foods. Analysis of total messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) extracts from liver for apoptosis-related gene expression changes in apoptosis enhancing nuclease (AEN), Bcl2-associated X protein (BAX), CASP3, Jun proto-oncogene (JUN), murine double minute-2 p53 binding protein homolog (MDM2), tumor protein p53 (p53), and GAPDH genes by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was coupled with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and caspase-3 (Casp3) activity assays. Specific apoptosis staining result does not seem to show significant difference between control and treated animals. This may be due to freeze-thaw artifacts observed in the liver samples. However, there appears to be a greater level of apoptosis in medium- and high-dose (MD and HD) 2AA treated animals. Analyses of apoptosis-related genes seem to show AEN and BAX as the main targets in the induction of apoptosis in response to 2AA exposure, though p53, MDM2, and JUN may play supporting roles. Dose-dependent increases in mRNA expression were observed in all genes except Casp3. BAX was very highly expressed in the HD rats belonging to the 2-week exposure group. This trend was not observed in the animals treated for 4 weeks. Instead, AEN was rather very highly expressed in the liver of the MD animals that were treated with 2AA for 28 days."

The DNA replication stress response protein SMARCAL1 stabilizes DNA replication forks and prevents replication fork collapse, a cause of DNA breaks and apoptosis. While the fork regression/remodeling functions of SMARCAL1 have been investigated, its in vivo functions in replication stress and cancer are unclear. Using a gamma radiation (IR)-induced replication stress T-cell lymphoma mouse model, we observed a significant inhibition of lymphomagenesis in mice lacking one or both alleles of Smarcal1 . Notably, a quarter of the Smarcal1-deficient mice did not develop tumors. Moreover, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and developing thymocytes in Smarcal1-deficient mice showed increased DNA damage and apoptosis during the proliferation burst following IR and an impaired ability to repopulate the thymus after IR. Additionally, mice lacking Smarcal1 showed significant HSPC defects when challenged to respond to other replication stress stimuli. Thus, our data reveal the critical function of the DNA replication stress response and specifically, Smarcal1 in hematopoietic cell survival and tumor development. Our results also provide important insight into the immunodeficiency observed in individuals with mutations in SMARCAL1 by suggesting that it is an HSPC defect."

This study aims to define the effects of magnesium levels on patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) regarding length of stay in the ICU, length of mechanical ventilation (MV), and 28-day mortality. The following data were collected during initial assessment of patients admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure (ARF). Demographic data, magnesium and potassium levels, Charlson's Comorbidity Index (CCI), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, length of MV, length of hospital stay in the ICU, 28-day mortality, and ICU discharge status. In the initial serum analysis prior to treatment of patients in the ICU, the mortality rate of the patient group with hypermagnesemia was found to be statistically significant when compared with other magnesium levels ( P =\u200a.018). Apart from renal failure, ICU mortality is higher in the hypermagnesemia group than other groups. Hypermagnesemia is an electrolyte abnormality that is generally seen in older individuals and those with serious comorbidity and it can be used in mortality prediction."

        "abstract": "The protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin features a unique benzylpyrrolidine system and exhibits potent selective activity against pathogenic protozoa and fungi. It is one of the important effective components in Agricultural Antibiotic120, which has been widely used as naturally-originated agents for treatment of crop decay in China. The chemical synthesis of anisomycin has recently been reported, but the complex process with low productivity made the biosynthesis still to be a vital mainstay in efforts. The biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of anisomycin in Streptomyces hygrospinosus var. beijingensis has been identified in our previous work, while poor understanding of the regulatory mechanism limited the yield enhancement via regulation engineering of S. hygrospinosus var. beijingensis. In this study here, we characterized AniF as an indispensable LuxR family transcriptional regulator for the activation of anisomycin biosynthesis. The genetic manipulations of aniF and the real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) revealed that it positively regulated the transcription of the anisomycin BGC. Moreover, the overexpression of aniF contributed to the improvement of the production of anisomycin and its derivatives. Dissection of the mechanism underlying the function of AniF revealed that it directly activated the transcription of the genes aniR - G involved in anisomycin biosynthesis. Especially, one AniF-binding site in the promoter region of aniR was identified by DNase I footprinting assay and an inverted repeat sequence (5\u2032-GGGC-3\u2032) composed of two 4-nt half sites in the protected region was found. Taken together, our systematic study confirmed the positive regulatory role of AniF and might facilitate the future construction of engineering strains with high productivity of anisomycin and its derivatives."

In the present study, a blast resistance gene in \u2018Asominori\u2019, tentatively named Pias (t), was revealed to be located within 162-kb region between DNA markers YX4-3 and NX4-1 on chromosome 4 and to be linked with an \u2018Asominori\u2019 allele of the bacterial leaf blight resistance gene Xa1 , tentatively named Xa1-as (t). An \u2018Asominori\u2019 allele of Pias (t) was found to be dominant and difference of disease severity between lines having the \u2018Asominori\u2019 allele of Pias (t) and those without it was 1.2 in disease index from 0 to 10. Pias (t) was also closely linked with the Ph gene controlling phenol reaction, suggesting the possibility of successful selection of blast resistance using the phenol reaction. Since blast-resistant commercial cultivars have been developed using \u2018Asominori\u2019 as a parent, Pias (t) is considered to be a useful gene in rice breeding for blast resistance."

Cd9 and Cd81 are highly expressed in breast cancer cells; however, their expression in healthy mammary glands is unclear. In this study, we performed quantitative real-time PCR to analyze the expression levels of Cd9 and Cd81 . Histological techniques were employed to identify Cd9- and Cd81 -expressing cells in rat mammary glands during pregnancy and lactation. It was observed that Cd9 and Cd81 were expressed in the mammary glands, and their expression levels correlated with mammary gland development. To identify cells expressing Cd9 and Cd81 in the mammary glands, we performed double immunohistochemical staining for CD9 and CD81, prolactin receptor long form, estrogen receptor alpha, or Ki67. The results showed that CD9 and CD81 were co-expressed in proliferating mammary epithelial cells. Next, we attempted to isolate CD9-positive epithelial cells from the mammary gland using pluriBead cell-separation technology based on antibody-mediated binding of cells to beads of different sizes, followed by isolation using sieves with different mesh sizes. We successfully isolated CD9-positive epithelial cells with 96.8% purity. In addition, we observed that small-interfering RNAs against Cd9 and Cd81 inhibited estrogen-induced proliferation of CD9-positive mammary epithelial cells. Our current findings may provide novel insights into the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells during pregnancy and lactation as well as in pathological processes associated with breast cancer."

In both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia in humans and its monkey model simian immunodeficiency virus encephalitis (SIVE), we find miR-21, a miRNA largely known for its link to oncogenesis, to be significantly upregulated in the brain. In situ hybridization of the diseased brain sections revealed induction of miR-21 in neurons. miR-21 can be induced in neurons by prolonged N-methyl--aspartic acid receptor stimulation, an excitotoxic process active in HIV and other neurodegenerative diseases. Introduction of miR-21 into human neurons leads to pathological functional defects. Furthermore, we show that miR-21 specifically targets the mRNA of myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), a transcription factor crucial for neuronal function, and reduces its expression. MEF2C is dramatically downregulated in neurons of HIV-associated dementia patients, as well as monkeys with SIVE. Together, this study elucidates a novel role for miR-21 in the brain, not only as a potential signature of neurological disease, but also as a crucial effector of HIV-induced neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration."

Several adverse psychological outcomes have been associated with stress and burnout. Improving coping can decrease the stress and burnout. There is limited literature on perceived stress, coping, and burnout among first-year medical undergraduates from India. With this background, the study aimed to assess perceived stress, coping, and burnout among first-year medical undergraduates.  Methods It was a cross-sectional study assessing 100 undergraduates studying in the first year of medical school. Medical Students Stressor Questionnaire, Brief COPE questionnaire, and Maslach burnout inventory\u2013student survey were applied for assessment of perceived stress, burnout, and coping, respectively. Socio-demographic profile was assessed by a semi-structured proforma.  Results Majority of students reported facing moderate level of stress in most of the domains, with stress being the highest for the academic aspects and least for social-related and drive- and desire-related areas. The stress was significantly greater in female students. Burnout was identified in 62% students by two-dimensional criteria and 30% by three-dimensional criteria. Among the coping strategies, active coping was most commonly used and substance use was less commonly used. No differences were found in coping between males and females except for active coping, which was significantly better in females.  Conclusion The stress was of moderate degree in majority of students and academic stress was the most common stress. Burnout was present in at least one-third of the students. However, majority of the students practiced active coping."

        "abstract": "Aerobic capacity has been shown to be inversely proportionate to cardiovascular mortality and morbidity and there is growing evidence that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) appears to be more effective than moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) in improving cardiorespiratory fitness within the cardiac population. Previously published systematic reviews in cardiovascular disease have neither investigated the effect that the number of weeks of intervention has on cardiorespiratory fitness changes, nor have adverse events been collated. We aimed to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) within the cardiac population that investigated cardiorespiratory fitness changes resulting from HIIT versus MICT and to collate adverse events. A critical narrative synthesis and meta-analysis was conducted after systematically searching relevant databases up to July 2017. We searched for RCTs that compared cardiorespiratory fitness changes resulting from HIIT versus MICT interventions within the cardiac population. Seventeen studies, involving 953 participants (465 for HIIT and 488 for MICT) were included in the analysis. HIIT was significantly superior to MICT in improving cardiorespiratory fitness overall (SMD 0.34 mL/kg/min; 95% confidence interval [CI; 0.2\u20130.48]; p <0.00001; I 2 =28%). There were no deaths or cardiac events requiring hospitalization reported in any study during training. Overall, there were more adverse events reported as a result of the MICT (n=14) intervention than the HIIT intervention (n=9). However, some adverse events (n=5) were not classified by intervention group. HIIT is superior to MICT in improving cardiorespiratory fitness in participants of cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness are significant for CR programs of >6-week duration. Programs of 7\u201312 weeks\u2019 duration resulted in the largest improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness for patients with coronary artery disease. HIIT appears to be as safe as MICT for CR participants."

A total of 117 sputum samples were collected from outpatients who attended Beijing Chest Hospital. DSSM, MPSM, solid culture, and Xpert MTB/RIF were performed on the samples. The positive rates of DSSM, MPSM, solid culture, and Xpert MTB/RIF were 27.4% (32/117), 40.2% (47/117), 35.9% (42/117), and 52.1% (61/117), respectively. MPSM could detect 15 more cases of tuberculosis compared with DSSM (47 vs 32) among 117 sputum samples. This represented a significantly higher positive rate and sensitivity of MPSM compared with DSSM. However, MPSM appeared to have a lower specificity (81.3%) compared with DSSM (90.7%) with the solid culture used as a standard. Use of MPSM can increase the number of positive sputum samples, but it still needs improvement."

The results were analyzed using Student\u2019s t-test and repeated measures ANOVA. Analyses via SEM and AFM confirmed that excellent coatings were obtained by using an electroplating method. The groups exhibited similar behavior when subjected to the disk diffusion test in the agar medium. However, the bacterial counts of the Ag-coated brackets were, in general, significantly lower (P<0.001) than those of their non-coated counterparts. Brackets coated with Ag, via an electroplating method, exhibited antibacterial properties when placed in direct contact with Streptococcus mutans. This antibacterial effect persisted for 30 days after contact with the bacteria."

        "abstract": "Antenatal care is a major contributor to the reduction of perinatal and maternal mortality and morbidity, through the identification of high risk pregnancies and early intervention for pregnant women with complications. Inadequate (less than eight contacts) and late antenatal care (starting after 12 weeks) have implications for the health of mothers, fetuses, and newborns. The aim of this study was to assess proportion and determinants of inadequate and late antenatal care among Saudi mothers in Unaizah, Qassim, Saudi Arabia. This was a cross-sectional study among 537 mothers who gave birth at King Saud Hospital, Unaizah City. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire covering sociodemographic information, antenatal care, and determinants that might affect the use of antenatal care. The data were entered into Excel and exported in STATA version 16. Simple and multiple logistic regressions were used to identify the determinants of inadequate and late antenatal care. The mean (standard deviation) age of the participants was 30.71 (5.73) years. The proportion of inadequate and late antenatal care was 34% (95% CI 30\u201338) and 25% (95% CI 21\u201329). Inadequate antenatal care was independently associated with employed mothers (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.13\u20133.22) and high parity (three or more) (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.17\u20134.16). Late antenatal care was independently associated with employed mothers (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.07\u20133.27) and high parity (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.01\u20134.16). This study found that the proportion of inadequate and late ANC was less than in other regions of Saudi Arabia, but it is still important to decrease this rate. The findings of this study will be useful for policy makers in Qassim region to help them design interventions to target mothers at high risk of inadequate and late ANC."

The present study was designed to investigate the role of lncRNA DGCR5 in the regulation of PaCa cell apoptosis. For this purpose, lncRNA DGCR5, miR-27a-3p and Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B-19kDa-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) expression levels were examined by reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis, respectively. RNA pull-down assay was used to verify DGCR5 as a target of miR-27a-3p and dual luciferase reporter assay was used to clarify whether miR-27a-3p targets the BNIP3 3\u2032 UTR. In addition, PaCa cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. Recombinant plasmids and cell transfection were performed to modulate the endogenous expression of related genes. Thereafter, the role of DGCR5 in PaCa was analyzed using a nude mouse model of PaCa. lncRNA DGCR5 was found to be downregulated in PaCa tissues and cells. DGCR5 functioned as a decoy of miR-27a-3p, and BNIP3 was negatively regulated by miR-27a-3p. Following the transfection of DGCR5 plasmid into PaCa cells, the expression of miR-27a-3p was downregulated, and this downregulation was reversed following transfection with miR-27a-3p mimic. In addition, DGCR5 regulated the BNIP3 and p38 MAPK pathways via miR-27a-3p and promoted PaCa cell apoptosis via the miR-27a-3p/BNIP3 pathway. The results of in vivo experiments also indicated the positive effects of DGCR5 on a nude mouse model of PaCa. On the whole, the findings of the present study indicate that lncRNA DGCR5 upregulates the BNIP3 and p38 MAPK pathways via miR-27a-3p to promote PaCa cell apoptosis, thereby attenuating PaCa development."

Systematic review and meta-analysis following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We performed a systematic search of PubMed and Embase (up to 9 September 2017), complemented with manual searches, of prospective population studies describing the association between sleep duration and quality and the incidence of dyslipidaemias. Relative risks (95% CIs) were extracted and pooled using a random effects model. Subgroup analyses by lipid type were performed. Heterogeneity and publication bias were also assessed. Quality was assessed with Downs and Black score. Studies were included if they were prospective, had measured sleep quantity and/or quality at baseline and either incident cases of dyslipidaemia or changes in blood lipid fractions assessed prospectively. Incidence of dyslipidaemia and changes in lipid fractions. Dyslipidaemia was defined as a high total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with the reference group. Thirteen studies were identified (eight using sleep duration, four sleep quality and one both). There was heterogeneity in the sleep quality aspects and types of lipids assessed. Classification of sleep duration (per hour/groups) also varied widely. In the pooled analysis of sleep duration (6 studies, 16 cohort samples; 30\u2009033 participants; follow-up 2.6\u201310 years), short sleep was associated with a risk of 1.01 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.10) of developing dyslipidaemia, with moderate heterogeneity (I 2 =56%, P=0.003) and publication bias (P=0.035). Long sleep was associated with a risk of 0.98 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.10) for dyslipidaemia, with heterogeneity (I 2 =63%, P<0.001) and no significant publication bias (P=0.248). The present analysis was unable to find supportive evidence of a significant relationship between sleep duration and the development of dyslipidaemia. However, heterogeneity and small number of studies limit the interpretation. CRD42016045242."

Furthermore, as a middle molecular weight substance, its concentration might be influenced by dialysis modality. In a cohort of patients treated with haemodialysis (HD) or haemodiafiltration (HDF), levels of NTproCNP were measured at baseline and 6, 12, 24 and 36\u2009months. The relation between serum NTproCNP and mortality and the relation between the 6-month rate of change of NTproCNP and mortality were analysed using Cox regression models. For the longitudinal analyses, linear mixed models were used. In total, 406 subjects were studied. The median baseline serum NTproCNP was 93\u2009pmol/L and the median follow-up was 2.97\u2009years. No relation between baseline NTproCNP or its rate of change over 6\u2009months and mortality was found. NTproCNP levels remained stable in HD patients, whereas NTproCNP decreased significantly in HDF patients. The relative decline depended on the magnitude of the convection volume. In our study, levels of NTproCNP appear strongly elevated in prevalent dialysis patients. Second, while NTproCNP remains unaltered in HD patients, its levels decline in individuals treated with HDF, with the decline dependent on the magnitude of the convection volume. Third, NTproCNP is not related to mortality in this population. Thus NTproCNP does not seem to be a useful marker for mortality risk in dialysis patients."

The work presented here describes a geographically weighted method combined with logistic regression for producing and visualizing the spatially distributed accuracy measures across the landscape. The outcomes compare the standard confusion matrix-based accuracy measures with those that have been permitted to differ locally. Furthermore, statistical parameters, i.e. Akaike information criterion, adjusted squared correlation coefficient ( R 2 ) and residual sum of squares (RSS) were employed to compare the performance of geographically weighted logistic regression (GWLR) with global ordinary least square regression technique. The GWLR technique was found to provide more reliable performance in estimating spatially varying accuracy measures. The results demonstrated that the geographically weighted approach offers additional and valuable insights for examining spatial variation in the context of landscape mapping accuracy."

E2F8 is a recently identified member of the E2F family with a duplicated DNA-binding domain feature discriminated from E2F1-6, controlling gene expression in a dimerization partner-independent manner. It is indispensable for angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis and embryonic development. Although E2F8 and E2F7 perform complementary and overlapping functions in many cell metabolisms, E2F8, but not E2F7, overexpresses remarkably in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to facilitate the HCC occurrence and development via activating a E2F1/ Cyclin D1 signaling pathway to regulate the G1- to S-phase transition of cell cycle progression or transcriptionally suppressing CDK1 to induce hepatocyte polyploidization. It also involves closely a variety of cellular physiological functions and pathological processes, which may bring a new breakthrough for the treatment of certain diseases, especially the HCC.

Metabolic consequences associated with PCOS include, but are not limited to, insulin resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the potential therapeutic roles of the incretin-based therapies in the management of PCOS. We performed a systematic search of databases including PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE up to 1 October 2020. We developed a search string of medical subject headings (MeSH) including the terms PCOS, incretin mimetics, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor antagonists (GLP-1 RAs), liraglutide, exenatide, semaglutide, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, combined with IR, testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). We identified 854 relevant articles and, after the initial screening, eight interventional animal studies, one observational animal study, 14 interventional human studies, two case\u2013control studies and one systematic review were included. These studies showed the potential significant roles of GLP-1 RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors in the management of PCOS, with significant improvements in the metabolic parameters, including substantial weight reduction and improved insulin sensitivity. These agents also improved the hormonal parameters through decreased free androgen and increased SHBG. Moreover, they improved menstrual regularity, increased fertility with enhanced ovulation and pregnancy in obese women with PCOS. GLP-1 RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors have a promising therapeutic role in PCOS; however, larger clinical trials are needed to establish the role of incretin-based therapies in the management of PCOS."

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have shown promise for prevention and treatment of HIV infection. However, it has been difficult to isolate mAbs that potently neutralize the highly pathogenic SIVmac239 strain. This has been largely due to the low frequency of circulating B cells encoding neutralizing Abs. Here we describe a novel technique to isolate mAbs directly from bone marrow-derived, Ab-secreting plasma cells. We employed an automated micromanipulator to isolate single SIVmac239 SOSIP.664-specific plasma cells from the bone marrow of a SIVmac239-infected RM with serum neutralization titers against SIVmac239. After picking plasma cells, we obtained 44 paired Ab sequences. Ten of these mAbs were SIV specific. Although none of these mAbs neutralized SIVmac239, three mAbs completely neutralized the related SIVmac316 strain. The majority of these mAbs bound to primary rhesus CD4+ T\u00a0cells infected with SIVmac239 and induced Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. This method is a first step in successful isolation of antigen-specific bone marrow-derived plasma cells from RMs. Pedre\u00f1o-Lopez et\u00a0al. adapted a previously described innovative fluorescence-based method to isolate antigen-specific plasma cells from total bone marrow of rhesus macaques using a micromanipulator. This method facilitated isolation and subsequent characterization of SIV-specific non-neutralizing antibodies with antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity that might be efficacious in\u00a0vivo ."

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of dihydromyricetin (DMY) on the human choriocarcinoma cell line, JAr, to identify a novel drug for the treatment of choriocarcinoma. An MTT assay was performed to determine the effects of DMY at different concentrations and for different exposure durations. Flow cytometry and TUNEL assays were performed to detect apoptosis, and western blotting was utilized to investigate the underlying mechanism. The results revealed that DMY significantly inhibited JAr cell viability in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The flow cytometry and TUNEL assays demonstrated that DMY inhibited proliferation by inducing apoptosis. Further analysis by western blotting indicated that the protein expression level of BCL-2 associated X, associated protein increased, while the protein expression levels of BCL-2 and pro-caspase-3 decreased. These findings suggest that DMY induced apoptosis in human choriocarcinoma JAr cells, through a mitochondrially mediated apoptotic pathway."

Emerging studies continue to identify obesity and several other obesity-related comorbid conditions as major risk factors for a more severe COVID-19 disease course. However, this also suggests that patients seeking bariatric surgery are inherently at risk of suffering severe complications if they were to contract COVID-19 in the perioperative period. The aim of this protocol is to utilize careful analysis of existing risk stratification for bariatric patients, novel COVID-19-related data, and consensus opinion from multiple academic bariatric centers within our organization to help guide the reanimation of our programs when appropriate and to use this template to prospectively study this risk-stratified population in real time.

Lysosomal autophagy is a group of processes that degrade proteins, protein aggregates, membranes, organelles, segregated regions of cytoplasm, and even parts of the nucleus in eukaryotic cells. These degradative processes are evolutionarily very ancient and provide a survival capability for cells that are stressed or injured. Autophagy and autophagic dysfunction have been linked with many aspects of cell physiology and pathology in disease processes; and there is now intense interest in identifying various therapeutic strategies involving its regulation. The main regulatory pathway for augmented autophagy is the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) cell signaling, although other pathways can be involved, such as 5\u2032-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase. Mechanistic target of rapamycin is a key player in the many highly interconnected intracellular signaling pathways and is responsible for the control of cell growth among other processes. Inhibition of mTOR (specifically dephosphorylation of mTOR complex 1) triggers augmented autophagy and the search is on the find inhibitors that can induce hormetic responses that may be suitable for treating many diseases, including many cancers, type 2 diabetes, and age-related neurodegenerative conditions."

Of these theories, the accumulation of oxidative damage over  time is among the most accepted. Particularly, the heart is one of the most  affected organs by oxidative stress. The current study, therefore, aimed to  investigate oxidative stress markers in myocardial tissue of rats at different  ages. Methods : Seventy-two rats were distributed into 6 groups of 12  animals each and maintained for 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months. After euthanasia,  the heart was removed and the levels of non-protein thiols, lipid peroxidation,  and protein carbonylation, as well as superoxide dismutase and catalase  activities were determined. Results: Superoxide dismutase, catalase  activity and lipid peroxidation were reduced in the older groups of animals,  when compared with the younger group. However, protein carbonylation showed an  increase in the 12-month group followed by a decrease in the older groups. In  addition, the levels of non-protein thiols were increased in the 12-month group  and not detected in the older groups. Conclusion: Our data showed that  oxidative stress is not associated with aging in the heart. However, an increase  in non-protein thiols may be an important factor that compensates for the  decrease of superoxide dismutase and catalase activity in the oldest rats, to  maintain appropriate antioxidant defenses against oxidative insults."

        "abstract": "Protective mechanical ventilation using low tidal volume has been introduced to surgical patients to reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. We investigated the effects of protective ventilation (PV) techniques on anesthesia-induced atelectasis identified via lung ultrasonography in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. A total of 42 adult patients who were scheduled for open abdominal surgery with an expected duration > 2 hours were included in the study. Patients were randomized to receive either conventional ventilation (CV; tidal volume of 9\u201310 mL/kg predicted body weight [PBW] with no positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP]) or PV (tidal volume of 6\u20138 mL/kg PBW and 5 cmH 2 O PEEP) via pressure-controlled ventilation with volume guaranteed. Lung ultrasonography was performed at four predefined time points to assess perioperative atelectasis by dividing each hemithorax into six quadrants based on a modified lung ultrasound (LUS) scoring system. The tidal volume delivered to patients was 9.65 \u00b1 1.65 mL/kg PBW in the CV group and 6.31 \u00b1 0.62 mL/kg PBW in the PV group. Ventilation using low tidal volume led to similar LUS scores in all lung areas and at all time points compared to ventilation using high tidal volume. There was no significant difference between the groups in the number of patients requiring recruitment maneuvers at the end of surgery. Ventilation with low tidal volume combined with 5 cmH 2 O PEEP did not cause further loss of aeration compared to ventilation with high tidal volume. Low tidal volume ventilation can be used in patients without lung injury based on lung assessment by bedside lung ultrasonography. Clinical Research Information Service Identifier: KCT0003746"

In our previous research, we found that miR-27a-3p expression was upregulated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) using a microarray chip. In the present study, we identified miR-27a-3p as an endogenous promoter of metastatic invasion. The expression levels of miR-27a-3p were correlated with human metastatic progression outcomes and Kaplan-Meier survival. In silico database analyses revealed that Mapk10 is a potential target of miR-27a-3p, and luciferase reporter assay results revealed that miR-27a-3p directly inhibits the Mapk10 3 untranslated region (3\u2032UTR). Real-time PCR and western blotting results ascertained that Mapk10 expression was regulated by miR-27a-3p. In addition, miR-27a-3p gain-of-function promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion in 5\u20138 F NPC cells. These effects partially depended on Mapk10, and loss of miR-27a-3p function had the opposite effects."

There are few studies about impact of green tea on hepatic diseases, thus we decided to investigate its impact on liver fibrosis. Forty male wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups: control group, GTE (green tea extract) group that received GTE powder dissolved in distilled water at doses of 125\u2005mg/kg body weight orally for four weeks, fibrosis group, that was injected carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)1ml/kg/IP (diluted in corn oil), 3 times per week for 4 weeks, GTE+CCl4 group that received GTE and CCl4 at the same time and corn oil group was administered corn oil 1\u2005mL/kg body weight three times a week for four weeks. In the end of study, the rats were sacrificed to measure serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The fibrosis group showed an increase in ALT, AST and ALP levels in comparison with the control group (P<0.01). Green tea reduced all of enzymes in fibrosis model significantly (P<0.05). GTE and corn oil had no effect on the enzymes in normal conditions. According to obtained results, GTE decrease liver enzymes in situations fibrosis. So it is suggested that the use of green tea can be useful in reduction of liver injuries."

We conducted a systematic review of EMBASE, MEDLINE, CENTRAL and grey literature for RCTs and non-randomised studies. We reported outcomes relating to change in HbA1c, fasting glucose, weight, blood pressure and lipids from baseline and need for treatment change. No study investigating macrovascular and microvascular diabetes complications was found. Meta-analysis was used where studies were sufficiently homogenous. Seven RCTs and five non-randomised studies were eligible for inclusion from 1335 articles retrieved. Meta-analysis of three homogenous RCTs revealed a statistically significant decrease in weight with sitagliptin when compared to sulfonylureas (weighted mean difference (WMD) \u22122.05\u2009kg; 95%\u2009CI \u22122.38 to \u22121.71); however, a similar change from baseline in HbA1c (WMD 0.05; 95%\u2009CI \u22120.03 to 0.12), fasting glucose (WMD 0.11; 95%\u2009CI \u22120.08 to \u20130.29), blood pressure, lipids and the proportion achieving HbA1c <7% by study end (OR 0.98; 95%\u2009CI 0.85 to 1.13) was observed. Non-randomised studies identified consisted of four prospective and one retrospective cohort study. Three of these five studies were of moderate/high quality, and results though less precise suggested similar real-world comparative glycaemic and weight effectiveness for both treatments. Data from two cohort studies suggested that treatment change (HR 0.65; 95%\u2009CI 0.57 to 0.73) and insulin initiation (HR 0.76; 95%\u2009CI 0.65 to 0.90) were less likely among those prescribed sitagliptin; however, inadequate reporting of HbA1c at time of treatment change made interpreting results challenging. Sitagliptin users experienced modest weight loss compared to gain with sulfonylureas; however, this difference was around 2\u2009kg, which may not be of major clinical significance for most individuals. Similar change was observed across most other effectiveness outcomes reported. Further studies are needed to address longer-term effectiveness outcomes for sitagliptin compared to sulfonylureas as add-on to metformin. CRD42016033983 ."

GE consisted of inulin and gelatin as gelling agent and characteristics of gelled and model system meat emulsions were investigated. GE showed good initial stability against centrifugation forces and thermal stability at different temperatures. GE addition decreased the pH with respect to increase in GE concentration. Addition of GE increased lightness and yellowness but reduced redness compared to control samples. The results of the study showed that partial replacement of beef fat with GE could be used for improving cooking yield without negative effects on water holding capacity and emulsion stability compared to C samples when replacement level is up to 50%. The presence of GE significantly affected textural behaviors of samples ( p <0.05). In conclusion, our study showed that GE have promising impacts on developing healthier meat product formulations besides improving technological characteristics."

To investigate the protective mechanisms of hypoxic preconditioning in relation to its effects on angiogenesis, we induced a photochemical model of cerebral infarction in an inbred line of mice (BALB/c). Mice were then exposed to hypoxic preconditioning 30 minutes prior to model establishment. Results showed significantly increased vascular endothelial growth factor and CD31 expression in the ischemic penumbra at 24 and 72 hours post infarction, mainly in neurons and vascular endothelial cells. Hy-Hypoxic preconditioning increased vascular endothelial growth factor and CD31 expression in the ischemic penumbra and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor was positively related to that of CD31. Moreover, hypoxic preconditioning reduced the infarct volume and improved rological function in mice. These findings indicate that the protective role of hypoxic preconditioning in acute cerebral infarction may possibly be due to an increase in expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and CD31 in the ischemic penumbra, which promoted angiogenesis."

However, the mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate podocyte injury induced by hypertension in the early course without massive proteinuria or renal dysfunction. The hypertension group comprised 18 patients with hypertension accompanied by microalbuminuria, diagnosed with hypertensive renal injury according to biopsy results. For a comparison of pathological changes in renal tissue, control group 1 comprised 10 healthy volunteers, and control group 2 comprised 16 patients who underwent surgery for renal trauma. The hypertension group had significantly higher blood pressure ( P = 0.000) and microalbuminuria ( P = 0.000) compared with control group 1. In the hypertension group, urinary podocytes were detected following positive staining of podocyte-specific nephrin and/or CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) in urine sediment. Podocyte foot process fusion and a significant decrease in nephrin and/or CD2AP expression in glomeruli were observed in the hypertension group compared with control group 2. This indicated that hypertension caused podocyte injury and detachment from the glomerular basement membrane, which was consistent with urinary detection of podocytes. Our results suggest that podocyturia appears early in the course of hypertensive renal injury, and may be a sensitive marker for early prediction of hypertensive renal injury."

Results from the prospective clinical trial of ravulizumab ( NCT02949128 ) reveal rapid resolution of TMA in patients with aHUS, with sustained efficacy and safety in a 26-week initial evaluation period. The aim of this analysis was to characterize the long-term efficacy and the safety profile of ravulizumab in adults with aHUS who had completed the initial evaluation period of the trial. Complete TMA response, hematologic and kidney functions, and safety were evaluated for all patients available for follow-up in the extension period (median follow-up: 76.7 weeks; range: 0.6\u2013118.3). This trial included a total of 58 patients, 49 of whom entered the extension period. A total of 4 additional patients achieved complete TMA response during the follow-up period. Normalization of platelet count, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and hemoglobin observed in the 26-week initial evaluation period was sustained until the last available follow-up, as were the improvements in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and patient quality of life. All efficacy endpoints were correlated with the sustained inhibition of complement C5. Most adverse events (AEs) occurred early during the initial evaluation period and decreased substantially during the extension period. No patient developed a meningococcal infection or died during the extension period. This analysis reveals that ravulizumab administered every 8 weeks is efficacious with an acceptable safety profile for the long-term treatment of adults with aHUS and provides additional clinical benefit beyond 6 months of treatment."

        "abstract": "There is great interest in therapeutically harnessing endogenous regenerative mechanisms to increase the number of \u03b2 cells in people with diabetes. By performing whole\u2010genome expression profiling of zebrafish islets, we identified 11 secreted proteins that are upregulated during \u03b2\u2010cell regeneration. We then tested the proteins' ability to potentiate \u03b2\u2010cell regeneration in zebrafish at supraphysiological levels. One protein, insulin\u2010like growth factor (Igf) binding\u2010protein 1 (Igfbp1), potently promoted \u03b2\u2010cell regeneration by potentiating \u03b1\u2010 to \u03b2\u2010cell transdifferentiation. Using various inhibitors and activators of the Igf pathway, we show that Igfbp1 exerts its regenerative effect, at least partly, by inhibiting Igf signaling. Igfbp1's effect on transdifferentiation appears conserved across species: Treating mouse and human islets with recombinant IGFBP 1 in\u00a0vitro increased the number of cells co\u2010expressing insulin and glucagon threefold. Moreover, a prospective human study showed that having high IGFBP 1 levels reduces the risk of developing type\u20102 diabetes by more than 85%. Thus, we identify IGFBP 1 as an endogenous promoter of \u03b2\u2010cell regeneration and highlight its clinical importance in diabetes."

Although existing studies suggest that osteoblast apoptosis induced by wear debris is involved in aseptic loosening, the underlying mechanism linking wear particles to osteoblast apoptosis remains almost totally unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effect of autophagy on osteoblast apoptosis induced by CoCrMo metal particles (CoPs) in vitro and in a calvarial resorption animal model. Our study demonstrated that CoPs stimulated autophagy in osteoblasts and PIO (particle-induced osteolysis) animal models. Both autophagy inhibitor 3-MA (3-methyladenine) and siRNA of Atg5 could dramatically reduce CoPs-induced apoptosis in osteoblasts. Further, inhibition of autophagy with 3-MA ameliorated the severity of osteolysis in PIO animal models. Moreover, 3-MA also prevented osteoblast apoptosis in an antiautophagic way when tested in PIO model. Collectively, these results suggest that autophagy plays a key role in CoPs-induced osteolysis and that targeting autophagy-related pathways may represent a potential therapeutic approach for treating particle-induced peri-implant osteolysis."

Retrospective study on all the renal cell carcinoma patients with bone metastases treated with sunitinib or sorafenib between November 2005 and June 2012 at the University Hospitals Leuven and AZ Groeninge in Kortrijk. Seventy-six patients were included in the outcome analysis: 49 treated with concomitant bisphosphonates, 27 with TKI alone. Both groups were well balanced in terms of prognostic and predictive markers. Response rate (38% vs 16% partial responses, P =0.028), median progression-free survival (7.0 vs 4.0 months, P =0.0011) and median overall survival (17.0 vs 7.0 months, P =0.022) were significantly better in patients receiving bisphosphonates. The incidence of ONJ was 10% in patients treated with TKI and bisphosphonates. Concomitant use of bisphosphonates and TKI in renal cell carcinoma patients with bone involvement probably improves treatment efficacy, to be confirmed by prospective studies, but is associated with a high incidence of ONJ."

In our previous in-vitro investigation, methanolic extract of A. indica stems (AIS) proved to be an effective a-glucosidase inhibitor, antioxidant, and well tolerated in acute and subchronic toxicity studies in albino wistar rats In this perspective, this study was designed to evaluate postprandial antihyperglycemic potential of AIS in maltose, sucrose, and glucose loaded streptozotocin (STZ)-induced normal and diabetic rats. As, the acute hyperglycemia at postprandial period has more triggering effect on oxidative stress, study was also aimed to evaluate the antioxidant potential of AIS on STZ-induced Albino\u2013Wistar rats. Rats were treated with AIS (300\u2013600 mg/kg b.w.) to investigate effect of AIS in controling PPHG after carbohydrate loading. Hepatoprotective activity of AIS is evaluated in diabetic rats by treating them at the dosages 300\u2013600 mg/kg b.w. Studies revealed 69.10 and 80.35% blood glucose-lowering effect of AIS in maltose and sucrose loaded diabetic rats in comparison with the diabetic control group.

This was a cross-sectional study of the prevalence of depression and anxiety among medical students, residents, and fellows at a medical university hospital in New York using self-reported PHQ-9 and GAD-7 screening tools administered via an anonymized survey. The study was conducted in April 2020. The authors received 438 responses (33.4% response rate). Nearly half (44.5%) were medical students and female (56.6%). The prevalence of positive screen for depression (45.3%) and anxiety (48.1%) was high. Many reported moderate to severe depression (17.2%) and anxiety (20.3%). Over half (57.3%) experienced significant mood changes and inability to concentrate, and 14.6% had reconsidered their choice of profession since the start of the pandemic. Those who had reconsidered their profession had higher PHQ-9 [8.1 (6.4) vs 4.4 (4.3), p < 0.0001] and GAD-7 scores [8.3 (6.1) vs 4.7 (4.6), p < 0.0001], indicating adverse mental health partly contributed to their reconsideration of choice of profession. Women were more likely to screen positive for anxiety (OR: 1.68) and medical students more likely to screen positive for anxiety (OR: 2.55) and depression (OR: 2.74). The COVID-19 pandemic has placed great strain on health-care resources, including the mental health of medical trainees."

Current treatments inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system but suppression of aldosterone may be incomplete. The aldosterone antagonist spironolactone has been shown to improve survival in patients with chronic, severe heart failure. Eplerenone is a selective aldosterone antagonist expected to have a lower incidence of hormonal side effects than spironolactone. To assess the evidence on the therapeutic value of eplerenone for treatment of heart failure in adults. The evidence base consists of one large double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter randomized trial in over 6000 patients with postmyocardial infarction (MI) heart failure, comparing eplerenone plus standard therapy with placebo plus standard therapy. All the main outcomes were patient-oriented. Evidence from this trial shows that eplerenone improves survival and reduces cardiovascular hospitalization/mortality, compared with standard treatment alone. The incidence of hormonal side effects is no greater than with placebo. The risk of hyperkalemia is significantly increased, especially in patients with low creatinine clearance. Eplerenone was both more effective and more costly than standard treatment alone. The cost-effectiveness ratio has been estimated at $US10 402\u201321 876 per life-year gained. Eplerenone reduces mortality compared with current treatment alone in patients with post-MI heart failure, at additional cost. Direct comparative evidence is needed to assess its efficacy versus spironolactone. It may be valuable in patients who are intolerant to the hormonal side effects of spironolactone."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between Ramadan fasting and acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (AUGIB), and to assess characteristics of those occurred in the holly month. Retrospective analysis was conducted for all patients, who underwent endoscopy for AUGIB in Ramadan (R) and the month before Ramadan (BR). Epidemiological, clinical and etiological characteristics and outcome of patients having AUGIB were compared between the two periods from 2001 to 2010. Two hundred and ninety-one patients had endoscopy for AUGIB during the two periods study. There was an increasing trend in the overall number of patients in Ramadan period (n = 132, 45.4% versus n = 159, 54.6%), especially with duodenal ulcer (n = 48, 37.2% versus n = 81, 62.8%). The most frequent etiology was peptic ulcer but it was more observed in group R than in group BR (46.2% versus 57.9%, P = 0.04), especially duodenal ulcer (36.4% versus 50.3%, P = 0.01); this finding persisted in multivariable modeling (adjusted odds ratio: 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.69, P = 0.03). In contrast, there was a decreasing trend in rate of variceal bleeding from BR period (26.5%) to R period (18.9%; P = 0.11). Regarding the outcome, there were no significant differences between the two periods of the study: Recurrent bleeding (10.6% versus 7.5%, P = 0.36) and mortality rate (5.3% versus 4.4%, P = 0.7). The most frequent etiology of AUGIB was peptic ulcer during Ramadan. However, Ramadan fasting did not influence the outcome of the patients. Prophylactic measures should be taken for people with risk factors for peptic ulcer disease."

        "abstract": "Personality is defined as the trait-like qualities of a person. However, it has been recently suggested that the state effect of a situation leads to changes in scores on personality assessments. We predicted that traumatic experiences would induce changes not only in personality scores but also in the factor structures of personality assessments. MethodsaaWe conducted a cross-sectional, case-controlled study using two data sets: a traumatized adolescent sample (n=71) and a non-traumatized adolescent sample (n=296). Personality factor structures were compared between the two samples using exploratory factor analyses for 25 lower-ordered subscales of the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). In the non-traumatized sample, evaluation of the scree plot suggested a five-factor solution supporting TCI's original seven-factor model. The traumatized sample showed a three-factor structure representing a biological factor, a social factor and an existential factor. This decrease in number of personality factors was caused by strengthened correlations among personality subscales related to coping with traumatic situations. Cloninger's psychobiological model of personality (i.e., temperament-character) was adequate in capturing personality traits of non-traumatized adolescents, but the tripartite view of existential psychology (i.e., body-mind-spirit) clearly corresponded to the factor structure of the traumatized adolescents. The three-factor solution of the present traumatized group is consistent with the tripartite model of personality (i.e., body-mind-spirit), while the five-factor solution of the non-traumatized group corresponds to Cloninger's seven-factor model. This is the first study to describe the state effects of traumatic experiences on personality structure."

        "abstract": "Homeodomain-leucine zipper type I (HD-Zip I) proteins are plant-specific transcription factors associated with the regulation of growth and development in response to changes in the environment. Nicotiana attenuata NaHD20 was identified as an HD-Zip I-coding gene whose expression was induced by multiple stress-associated stimuli including drought and wounding. To study the role of NaHD20 in the integration of stress responses with changes in growth and development, its expression was silenced by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), and control and silenced plants were metabolically and developmentally characterized. Phytohormone profiling showed that NaHD20 plays a positive role in abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation in leaves during water stress and in the expression of some dehydration-responsive genes including ABA biosynthetic genes. Moreover, consistent with the high levels of NaHD20 expression in corollas, the emission of benzylacetone from flowers was reduced in NaHD20 -silenced plants. Additionally, bolting time and the opening of the inflorescence buds was decelerated in these plants in a specific developmental stage without affecting the total number of flowers produced. Water stress potentiated these effects; however, after plants recovered from this condition, the opening of the inflorescence buds was accelerated in NaHD20 -silenced plants. In summary, NaHD20 plays multiple roles in N. attenuata and among these are the coordination of responses to dehydration and its integration with changes in flower transitions."

The authors conducted a cross-sectional survey among 625 Indian students across various Indian universities and structural equation modeling (SEM) has been performed for analyzing the data. The findings of the study show a positive effect of fear of COVID-19 on stress with \u03b2 =\u2009.27, p <\u20090.05, and a negative effect on well-being ( \u03b2 =\u2009\u2212.13, p <\u20090.05). The results also depicted the mediating role of stress between fear of COVID-19 and well-being. Therefore, it is suggested that measures must be taken by individuals, society, and policy makers to include mental health maintenance in the pandemic response activities. Further longitudinal studies in different geographical regions and demographics can provide a more generalized understanding of the relationship between the pandemic and mental health. The limitations, policy implications, and suggestions are discussed."

We hypothesized that the GH response to the WAnT would be similar to the GH response to a commonly used pharmacologic provocation test. Ten children (6 males and 4 females, age range 9.0\u201314.9 years) participated in the study. Each participant performed 2 tests: a standard all-out WAnT, cycling for 30\u2009s against constant resistance, and a standardized pharmacologic test (clonidine or glucagon). Blood samples for GH were collected before and 10, 30, 45, and 60\u2009min after the beginning of exercise. In addition, we collected pre- and post-exercise blood lactate levels. There was a significant increase in GH levels after the WAnT, yet in 9 of 10 participants, this increase was below the threshold for GH sufficiency. Peak GH after the WAnT was significantly lower compared to the pharmacologic GH provocation tests (with 9 of 10 demonstrating GH-sufficient response). The traditional WAnT cannot be used as a GH provocation test. Further research is needed to develop anaerobic exercise protocols sufficient to promote GH secretion."

Tandem mass spectrometry has been used in newborn screening (NBS), allowing the detection of patients with VLCAD deficiency even before symptoms manifest. However, tandem mass spectrometry has a high false positive rate. We investigated the clinical characteristics of patients with false positive results for tetradecenoyl acylcarnitine (C14:1). This case-control study used data collected between the 1st of January 2014 and the 31st of March 2019. The case group was defined as patients having levels of both C14:1 and C14:1/C2 ratio higher than cut-off levels in the first newborn mass screening, who were eventually diagnosed as false positives by attending doctors at Kobe University Hospital, Palmore Hospital, or Kakogawa Central City Hospital in Japan. The control group comprised 100 patients randomly selected from the three facilities. The false positive group included 17 cases, and the control group contained 300 patients. The demographics of each group did not show any significant differences in sex, body weight at birth, Cesarean section rate, complete breastfeeding rate, or the number of feedings per day. However, the change in body weight at the sampling day of NBS in the false positive and control groups was \u221210.2%, and\u00a0\u2212\u00a04.6%, respectively, showing a statistically significant difference ( p <\u00a00.01). In addition, body weight gain at the one-month medical checkup was 38.9\u00a0g/day in the false positive group and 44.1\u00a0g/day in the control group ( p <\u00a00.05). An elevation of C14:1 carnitine has been reported in situations involving the catalysis of fatty acid. Therefore, patients with severe body weight loss might be associated with poor sucking or poor milk supply, which might cause a false positive elevation of C14:1 and C14:1/C2. In suspected VLCAD deficiency, attending doctors should pay attention to body weight changes recorded during newborn mass screening. \u2022 VLCAD deficiency is the most common fatty acid oxidation disorder in Japan. \u2022 Tandem mass spectrometry during newborn screening facilitates its early detection. \u2022 Tandem mass spectroscopy has a high false positive rate. \u2022 Here, clinical characteristics of false-positive patients were investigated. \u2022 False-positive patients showed significant loss of weight during newborn screening.

        "abstract": "Uncontrolled bleeding associated with trauma and surgery is the leading cause of preventable death. Batroxobin, a snake venom-derived thrombin-like serine protease, has been shown to clot fibrinogen by cleaving fibrinopeptide A in a manner distinctly different from thrombin, even in the presence of heparin. The biochemical properties of batroxobin and its effect on coagulation have been well characterized in vitro . However, the efficacy of batroxobin on hemostatic clot formation in vivo is not well studied due to the lack of reliable in vivo hemostasis models. Here, we studied the efficacy of batroxobin and slounase, a batroxobin containing activated factor X, on hemostatic clot composition and bleeding using intravital microcopy laser ablation hemostasis models in micro and macro vessels and liver puncture hemostasis models in normal and heparin-induced hypocoagulant mice. We found that prophylactic treatment in wild-type mice with batroxobin, slounase and activated factor X significantly enhanced platelet-rich fibrin clot formation following vascular injury. In heparin-treated mice, batroxobin treatment resulted in detectable fibrin formation and a modest increase in hemostatic clot size, while activated factor X had no effect. In contrast, slounase treatment significantly enhanced both platelet recruitment and fibrin formation, forming a stable clot and shortening bleeding time and blood loss in wild-type and heparin-treated hypocoagulant mice. Our data demonstrate that, while batroxobin enhances fibrin formation, slounase was able to enhance hemostasis in normal mice and restore hemostasis in hypocoagulant conditions via the enhancement of fibrin formation and platelet activation, indicating that slounase is more effective in controlling hemorrhage."

        "abstract": " BACKGROUND: Despite many publications about cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), controversy remains regarding diagnostic and management strategies.  OBJECTIVE: To develop guidelines for CCM management.  METHODS: The Angioma Alliance ( www.angioma.org ), the patient support group in the United States advocating on behalf of patients and research in CCM, convened a multidisciplinary writing group comprising expert CCM clinicians to help summarize the existing literature related to the clinical care of CCM, focusing on 5 topics: (1) epidemiology and natural history, (2) genetic testing and counseling, (3) diagnostic criteria and radiology standards, (4) neurosurgical considerations, and (5) neurological considerations. The group reviewed literature, rated evidence, developed recommendations, and established consensus, controversies, and knowledge gaps according to a prespecified protocol.  RESULTS: Of 1270 publications published between January 1, 1983 and September 31, 2014, we selected 98 based on methodological criteria, and identified 38 additional recent or relevant publications. Topic authors used these publications to summarize current knowledge and arrive at 23 consensus management recommendations, which we rated by class (size of effect) and level (estimate of certainty) according to the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association criteria. No recommendation was level\u00a0A (because of the absence of randomized controlled trials), 11 (48%) were level\u00a0B, and 12 (52%) were level\u00a0C. Recommendations were class\u00a0I in 8 (35%), class\u00a0II in 10 (43%), and class\u00a0III in 5 (22%).  CONCLUSION: Current evidence supports recommendations for the management of CCM, but their generally low levels and classes mandate further research to better inform clinical practice and update these recommendations. The complete recommendations document, including the criteria for selecting reference citations, a more detailed justification of the respective recommendations, and a summary of controversies and knowledge gaps, was similarly peer reviewed and is available on line www.angioma.org/CCMGuidelines ."

These regulators exert their functions at hierarchical levels. At the lower level, cluster-situated regulators (CSRs) directly control the transcription of neighboring genes within the gene cluster. Higher-level pleiotropic and global regulators exert their functions mainly through modulating the transcription of CSRs. Advances in understanding of the regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis in actinomycetes have inspired us to engineer these regulators for strain improvement and antibiotic discovery."

        "abstract": "Data mining for a phylogenetic study including the prominent ericoid mycorrhizal fungus Rhizoscyphus ericae revealed nearly identical ITS sequences of the bryophilous Hyaloscypha hepaticicola suggesting they are conspecific. Additional genetic markers and a broader taxonomic sampling furthermore suggested that the sexual Hyaloscypha and the asexual Meliniomyces may be congeneric. In order to further elucidate these issues, type strains of all species traditionally treated as members of the Rhizoscyphus ericae aggregate (REA) and related taxa were subjected to phylogenetic analyses based on ITS, nrLSU, mtSSU, and rpb 2 markers to produce comparable datasets while an in\u00a0vitro re-synthesis experiment was conducted to examine the root-symbiotic potential of H.\u00a0hepaticicola in the Ericaceae . Phylogenetic evidence demonstrates that sterile root-associated Meliniomyces , sexual Hyaloscypha and Rhizoscyphus , based on R.\u00a0ericae , are indeed congeneric. To this monophylum also belongs the phialidic dematiaceous hyphomycetes Cadophora finlandica and Chloridium paucisporum . We provide a taxonomic revision of the REA; Meliniomyces and Rhizoscyphus are reduced to synonymy under Hyaloscypha . Pseudaegerita , typified by P.\u00a0corticalis , an asexual morph of H.\u00a0spiralis which is a core member of Hyaloscypha , is also transferred to the synonymy of the latter genus. Hyaloscypha melinii is introduced as a new root-symbiotic species from Central Europe. Cadophora finlandica and C.\u00a0paucisporum are confirmed conspecific, and four new combinations in Hyaloscypha are proposed. Based on phylogenetic analyses, some sexually reproducing species can be attributed to their asexual counterparts for the first time whereas the majority is so far known only in the sexual or asexual state. Hyaloscypha bicolor sporulating in\u00a0vitro is reported for the first time. Surprisingly, the mycological and mycorrhizal sides of the same coin have never been formally associated, mainly because the sexual and asexual morphs of these fungi have been studied in isolation by different research communities. Evaluating all these aspects allowed us to stabilize the taxonomy of a widespread and ecologically well-studied group of root-associated fungi and to link their various life-styles including saprobes, bryophilous fungi, root endophytes as well as fungi forming ericoid mycorrhizae and ectomycorrhizae."

Interplay between the \u03b2-catenin and Notch pathways during tumorigenesis has been reported, but the mechanisms involved and the role of Notch remain unclear. Notch status was analysed by studying expression of the Notch effector Hes1 and Notch ligands/receptors in human colorectal cancer (CRC) and mouse models of Apc mutation. A genetic approach was used, deleting the Apc and RBP-J or Atoh1 genes in murine intestine. CRC cell lines were used to analyse the control of Hes1 and Atoh1 by \u03b2-catenin signalling. Notch signalling was found to be activated downstream from \u03b2-catenin. It was rapidly induced and maintained throughout tumorigenesis. Hes1 induction was mediated by \u03b2-catenin and resulted from both the induction of the Notch ligand/receptor and Notch-independent control of the Hes1 promoter by \u03b2-catenin. Surprisingly, the strong phenotype of unrestricted proliferation and impaired differentiation induced by acute Apc deletion in the intestine was not rescued by conditional Notch inactivation. Hyperactivation of \u03b2-catenin signalling overrode the forced differention induced by Notch inhibition, through the downregulation of Atoh1, a key secretory determinant factor downstream of Notch. This process involves glycogen synthase kinase 3 \u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) and proteasome-mediated degradation. The restoration of Atoh1 expression in CRC cell lines displaying \u03b2-catenin activation was sufficient to increase goblet cell differentiation, whereas genetic ablation of Atoh1 greatly increased tumour formation in Apc mutant mice. Notch signalling is a downstream target of \u03b2-catenin hyperactivation in intestinal tumorigenesis. However, its inhibition had no tumour suppressor effect in the context of acute \u03b2-catenin activation probably due to the downregulation of Atoh1. This finding calls into question the use of \u03b3-secretase inhibitors for the treatment of CRC and suggests that the restoration of Atoh1 expression in CRC should be considered as a therapeutic approach."

        "abstract": "The novel coronavirus is the worst pandemic of this century. Unfortunately, there is no clear solution for how to cope with such an epidemic. This study examines the coping strategies used by university students in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. From March to May 2020, a questionnaire was administered and completed by 400 students. This study used the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to examine the respondents\u2019 level of anxiety. The results indicate that 35% of students experienced some levels of anxiety. Moreover, there was a moderate use of four types of coping strategies: Seek social support, acceptance, mental disengagement, and humanitarian. These findings can guide policymakers on the importance of developing practical guidelines to handle such lethal diseases. Moreover, the results inform the Saudi community what strategies were used to cope so far with the pandemic. Future research is expected to address the validity and appropriateness of these strategies and encourage other approaches. Significance for public health Students, being part of the community, are experiencing the social and psychological impacts of the novel COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to coping with the new methods of learning and assessments, the fear of them or their loved ones contracting the disease and the unusual quarantine circumstances could lead to social and psychological anxiety. Such anxiety can affect their well-being and threatened the health status of their families. Thus, this study aims to address their concerns and learn about the strategic interventions that need to be put in place to minimize any adverse or long-term effects of the pandemic in students\u2019 lives. The research outcome brings added value for universities to adopt and incorporate feasible and fair approaches in handling students' socio-psychological preparedness. Moreover, the findings enlighten the public on the appropriate coping strategies and the suitable adaptability skills that can be emphasized to pass through such a pandemic with a minimum health effect.

This study consisted of 44 rabbits served as HF group and 9 normal rabbits. HF group was divided into two subgroups: Group A ( n = 32) and Group B ( n = 12). Rabbits in Group B were served as a complementary group when rabbits in Group A suddenly died during the study. Rabbits from control and Group A underwent abdominal MR imaging (MRI), MRE, and DWI. In Group A, random eight rabbits underwent MRI examinations at 4, 5, 6, 10 weeks after carbon tetrachloride oil subcutaneous injection. Liver stiffness (LS) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of liver parenchyma were measured. The diagnostic performance of MRE and DWI for staging HF was compared using the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis on the basis of the histopathological analysis of HF. Significant differences of LS and DWI values were present among HF stages ( P < 0.005). The LS values measured on MRE ( r = 0.838, P < 0.001) were more strongly correlated with the HF stages than with ADC values ( r = \u22120.527, P < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of LS were significantly larger than those of DWI were for discriminating two stages of HF (0.979 vs. 0.712 for \u2265 S1, 0.922 vs. 0.699 for \u2265 S2). MRE showed higher specificity for predicting all stages of HF compared to DWI. MRE more strongly correlated with the HF stages than DWI and is more specific in predicting all HF stages."

        "abstract": "Fruit colour affects consumer preference and is an important trait for breeding in strawberry. Previously, we isolated the Reduced Anthocyanins in Petioles ( RAP ) gene encoding a glutathione S\u2010transferase (GST) that binds anthocyanins to facilitate their transport from cytosol to vacuole in the diploid strawberry Fragaria vesca . The parent of rap was the F.\u00a0vesca variety \u2018Yellow Wonder\u2019 that develops white fruit due to a natural mutation in the FveMYB10 gene. Here, we investigated the application potential of RAP in modulating fruit colours by overexpression of RAP in F.\u00a0vesca and knockout of RAP in the cultivated strawberry Fragaria\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0ananassa . Unexpectedly, the RAP overexpression in Yellow Wonder background caused formation of red fruit. In addition, the red coloration occurs precociously at floral stage 10 and continues in the receptacle during early fruit development. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the anthocyanin biosynthesis genes were not up\u2010regulated in RAP\u2010ox; rap myb10 flowers at anthesis and largely inhibited at the turning stage in fruit, suggesting a coloration mechanism independent of FveMYB10 . Moreover, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout RAP in cultivated strawberry which is octoploid. Six copies of RAP were simultaneously knocked out in the T0 generation leading to the green stem and white\u2010fruited phenotype. Several T1 progeny have segregated away the CRISPR/Cas9 transgene but maintain the green stem trait. Our results indicate that enhancing the anthocyanin transport could redirect the metabolic flux from proanthocyanidin to anthocyanin production at early developmental stages of fruit and that RAP is one promising candidate gene in fruit colour breeding of strawberry."

The HI, CI, and BI were determined in a primary health center (PHC) in the village of Maruthamputhur (Pappakudi taluk, Tirunelveli) by carrying out an antilarval (AL) work that involved door-to-door search for immature stages of Aedes spp. mosquitoes by trained field workers and volunteers. The work of field workers was evaluated by a junior and senior entomologist the following day. Before the AL work, the reported numbers of fever cases from Week 1 to 5 in Maruthamputhur were 211, 394, 244, 222, and 144 with two deaths. By contrast, after the AL work, these numbers were considerably reduced and there was no fever-related death (the HI was reduced from 48.2% to 1.6%, the CI from 28.6% to 0.4%, and the BI from 48.2 to 1.6). Because no specific medicine and vaccines are available to treat dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever, entomological surveillance and its significance can be used to halt the outbreak of dengue as shown in this study."

        "abstract": "Asthma is a common worldwide health burden, the prevalence of which is increasing. Recently, the biologically active form of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, has been reported to have a protective role in murine asthma; however, the molecular mechanisms by which vitamin D3 attenuates asthma-associated airway injury remain elusive. In the present study, BALB/c mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) and were administered 100 ng 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (intraperitoneal injection) 30 min prior to each airway challenge. The inflammatory responses were measured by ELISA, airway damage was analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, airway remodeling was analyzed by Masson staining and periodic acid-Schiff staining, markers of oxidative stress were measured by commercial kits, and the expression levels of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and the activity of the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)/Smad signaling pathways were measured by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. The results demonstrated that OVA-induced airway inflammation and immunoglobulin E overexpression were significantly reduced by vitamin D3 treatment. In addition, treatment with vitamin D3 decreased \u03b1-SMA expression, collagen deposition and goblet cell hyperplasia, and inhibited TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling in the asthmatic airway. The upregulated levels of malondialdehyde, and the reduced activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione in OVA-challenged mice were also markedly restored following vitamin D3 treatment. Furthermore, treatment with vitamin D3 enhanced activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in the airways of asthmatic mice. In conclusion, these findings suggest that vitamin D3 may protect airways from asthmatic damage via the suppression of TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling and activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway; however, these protective effects were shown to be accompanied by hypercalcemia."

Their pathogenesis involves genes and environment as cofactors in inducing autoimmunity; particularly the interactions between enteric pathogens and immunity is being studied. Helicobacter pylori ( HP ) is common pathogen causing gastric inflammation. Studies found an inverse prevalence association between HP and IBD, suggesting a potential protecting role of HP from IBD. Methods: A literature search of the PubMed database was performed using the key words\u2018\u2019helicobacter pylori\u2019\u2019,\u2018\u2019inflammatory bowel disease\u2019\u2019,\u2018\u2019crohn disease\u2019\u2019, \u201culcerative colitis\u201d. Embase, Medline (OvidSP), Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed publisher, Cochrane and Google Scholar were also searched. Prevalence rate-ratios among HP in IBD patients, HP in CD patients, HP in UC patients, HP in IBDU patients were extracted, each group was compared with controls, to verify the inverse association between HP and IBD prevalence. Results: In all groups the dispersion of data suggested an inverse association between IBD group and controls, even when the comparison was carried out separately between each group of newly diagnosed patients and controls, to rule out the possible bias of ongoing pharmacologic therapy. Conclusions: The results of this review show a striking inverse association between HP infection and the prevalence of IBD, independently from the type of IBD considered across distinct geographic regions. Anyway, data should be interpreted cautiously, as wider, prospective and more homogeneous research on this topic are awaited, which could open new scenarios about environmental etiology of IBD.

Oxaliplatin, a platinum-based drug, is used for the chemotherapy of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, oxaliplatin resistance is a major challenge in the treatment of advanced CRC. The aim of the present study was to better understand the mechanism underlying the chemosensitivity of CRC cells to oxaliplatin. The present study describes a potential novel strategy for enhancing oxaliplatin sensitivity involving the glycosylation of this drug transporter, specifically the modification of \u03b2-1,6-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V). The results revealed that the downregulation of GnT-V inhibited the oxaliplatin chemosensitivity of CW-2 cells. Furthermore, the knockdown of GnT-V caused a marked reduction in the presence of \u03b2-1,6-GlcNAc structures on OCT2 and decreased the localization of OCT2 in the cytomembrane, which were associated with a reduced uptake of oxaliplatin in wild-type and oxaliplatin-resistant CW-2 cells. Overall, the study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanism by which GnT-V regulates the chemosensitivity to oxaliplatin, which involves the modulation of the drug transporter OCT2 by N-glycosylation in CRC cells."

It is one of the leading causes of adult mortality and morbidity, but poorly controlled hypertension remains a major health problem. The objective of this study was to find out awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension among study population and association of hypertension awareness with sociodemographic factors, if any. This study was conducted from May 2013 to April 2014 in the rural community of Singur block, West Bengal. Data were collected with respect to sociodemographic characteristics as well as records related to hypertension such as awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) measurement of individuals aged 20 years and above of both sexes was done. Pearson's Chi-square test was performed to find out the association between the categorical variables. SPSS 19.00 software was used for analysis. Nearly 48.2% of the participants were aware of their elevated BP; 47.1% of the participants were taking pharmacological treatment, mostly allopathic and only 8.8% had their BP under control. A statistically significant association was found between age, education, and socioeconomic status (per capita income) with awareness of hypertension. Lack of awareness of the disease and very low rate of control of hypertension among those who were treated became the major issues. These findings emphasize the need for dissemination of knowledge about the disease and counseling of the patients during treatment continuation."

It has the effect of anti-apoptosis, protecting macrophages that have engulfed pathogens and preventing pathogen clearance. Meanwhile, the MAPK signaling pathway plays a significant role in regulating Mcl-1 expression during tuberculosis infection. In the case of latent infection and active infection, the apoptosis and polarization of macrophages have a great influence during MTB infection, so we discussed the effect of Mcl-1 on apoptosis and polarization. Then, further discussed its mechanism. An infected RAW264.7 macrophage model was established to investigate the regulatory role and mechanism of the Mcl-1 pathway inhibition during apoptosis and polarization of H37Rv infection. First, Mcl-1 protein and mRNA was identified by western blotting and Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). RAW264.7 macrophage apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. RT-PCR was utilized to detect Bax, Caspase-3, Cyt-c and Bcl-2 mRNA expression. Next, Then the expression levels of inflammation factors CD86, CD206, iNOS, Fizz1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, and TGF-\u03b2 was detected by ELISA. SEM was used to observe macrophages phenotype. Finally, Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl the expression was detected by western blotting. Confocal microscopy was used to analyze mitochondrial membrane potential using the JC-10 kit. In this study, we found that inhibiting the Mcl-1 expression signaling pathway led to infection by different virulence Mycobacterium tuberculosis , as well as changes in Mcl-1 protein and mRNA expression. Concomitantly macrophage apoptosis rate also changed, While, two phenotypic states of M1 and M2 appeared in the infected cells. We also found that the mitochondrial pathway was activated, the expression of its related genes Bax, casepase3, and Cyt-c, increased, whereas that of Bcl-2 decreased, and the mitochondrial membrane depolarization function was changed. We found that Mcl-1 affected the apoptosis and polarization of macrophages infected by Mycobacterium tuberculosis , mainly M1 in the early stage and M2 in the later stage. In addition, mitochondria played a crucial role in this process."

This software exploits the finite volume method that is based on the resolution of the Navier-Stokes equations. The distribution of the temperature, velocity, static pressure, turbulent kinetic energy, turbulent viscosity, and turbulent dissipation is tested in different planes and different directions to characterize the airflow indoor a heated room. Equally, the thermal comfort is examined by calculating the predicted mean vote (PMV). The comparison between the numerical results and the experimental data founded from the literature prove that the supply of airflow was affected by the presence of the heat sources and the thermal climate is considered as a slightly hot. The use of the adequate meshes is in a good agreement with the experimental data and confirms the validity of the numerical approach.

        "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested a potential role for liraglutide in the prevention and stabilization of atherosclerotic vascular disease. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of liraglutide on atherosclerosis have not been well elucidated. The purpose of this study was to examine whether liraglutide protects against oxidative stress and fatty degeneration via modulation of AMP-activated\u00a0protein\u00a0kinase (AMPK)/sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP1) signaling pathway in foam cells. Mouse macrophages Raw264.7 cells were exposed to oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) to induce the formation of foam cells. The cells were incubated with oxLDL (50 \u00b5g/mL), liraglutide (0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2 nmol/L) or exendin-3 (9-39) (1, 10 and 100 nmol/L) alone, or in combination. Oil Red O staining was used to detect intracellular lipid droplets. The levels of TG and cholesterol were measured using the commercial kits. Oxidative stress was determined by measuring intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD). Western blot analysis was used to examine the expression of AMPK\u03b11, SREBP1, phosphorylated AMPK\u03b11, phosphorylated SREBP1, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R). Oil Red O staining showed that the cytoplasmic lipid droplet accumulation was visibly decreased in foam cells by treatment with liraglutide. The TG and cholesterol content in the liraglutide-treated foam cells was significantly decreased. In addition, foam cells manifested an impaired oxidative stress following liraglutide treatment, as evidenced by increased SOD, and decreased ROS and MDA. However, these effects of liraglutide on foam cells were attenuated by the use of GLP-1R antagonist exendin-3 (9-39). Furthermore, we found that the expression level of AMPK\u03b11 and phosphorylated AMPK\u03b11 was significantly increased while the expression level of SREBP1 and phosphorylated SREBP1 was significantly decreased in foam cells following treatment with liraglutide. This study for the first time demonstrated that the effect of liraglutide on reducing oxidative stress and fatty degeneration in oxLDL-induced Raw264.7 cells is accompanied by the alteration of AMPK/SREBP1 pathway. This study provided a potential molecular mechanism for the effect of liraglutide on reducing oxidative stress and fatty degeneration."

The incidence of thyroid nodules increases with age, making the thyroid more nodular. Hypothyroidism is common in the elderly and, if untreated, is associated with significant morbidity. Elderly patients are sensitive to iatrogenic hyperthyroidism, especially with preexisting cardiac disease. Hence, treatment of hypothyroidism should be individualized and should be started with low doses and titrated according to response. Hyperthyroidism, although less common in the elderly if present, is associated with significant cardiac morbidity and mortality. Radioiodine therapy is considered a safe primary treatment in the elderly with hyperthyroidism. Management of subclinical hypo- and hyperthyroidism is still controversial. The incidence of thyroid tumors increase with age. Thyroid malignancy in the elderly is considered as a more advanced disease compared with the young, and aggressive management is recommended."

        "abstract": "tRNA\u2010derived fragments (tRFs) have been found to play a regulatory role in the occurrence and development of many tumors. The aim of this study was to identify the expression of tRFs in breast cancer and their ability to serve as diagnostic markers for breast cancer. Total RNA was extracted from breast cancer and paracancerous tissues ( n =\u200983), as well as from the sera of breast cancer patients ( n =\u2009214) and healthy donors ( n =\u2009113) using trizol reagents. Expression of tRFs was then detected by q\u2010PCR, and analyzed using t \u2010test and ROC to illuminate their potential as biomarkers for breast cancer. Our results demonstrated that tRFs: tRF\u2010Gly\u2010CCC\u2010046, tRF\u2010Tyr\u2010GTA\u2010010 and tRF\u2010Pro\u2010TGG\u2010001 were downregulated in both tissues and sera from breast cancer patients as well as early\u2010stage patients compared with those in the healthy donors. More importantly, the three tRFs were capable of serving as circulating biomarkers of diagnostics and early diagnosis of breast cancer, possessing areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.7871 and 0.7987, respectively. tRFs: tRF\u2010Gly\u2010CCC\u2010046, tRF\u2010Tyr\u2010GTA\u2010010 and tRF\u2010Pro\u2010TGG\u2010001 are downregulated in breast cancer and early breast cancer and act as new potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and early diagnosis of breast cancer. As shown in the technology roadmap, due to the low primer specificity and expression levels, some tRFs were ruled out and others were subjected to validation in fresh tissues, including 23 breast cancer tissues and paired paracancerous tissues. After that, tRF\u2010Gly\u2010CCC\u2010046, tRF\u2010Tyr\u2010GTA\u2010010 and tRF\u2010Pro\u2010TGG\u2010001 were observed with significant decrease in breast cancer tissue and selected as the candidates. The three differential tRFs were further verified in expanded tissue ( n =\u200983) and serum cohorts ( n =\u2009214). Finally, ROC curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the three tRFs for breast cancer and early breast cancer. "

We fed obesity-prone C57BL/6J mice high-fat diets with either casein (HF casein) or whey (HF whey) for 6 weeks. At equal energy intake and apparent fat and nitrogen digestibility, mice fed HF whey stored less energy as lipids, evident both as lower white adipose tissue mass and as reduced liver lipids, compared with HF-casein-fed mice. Explorative analyses of 48 h urine, both by 1 H NMR and LC\u2013MS metabolomic platforms, demonstrated higher urinary excretion of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates citric acid and succinic acid (identified by both platforms), and cis -aconitic acid and isocitric acid (identified by LC\u2013MS platform) in the HF whey, relative to in the HF-casein-fed mice. Targeted LC\u2013MS analyses revealed higher citric acid and cis-aconitic acid concentrations in fed state plasma, but not in liver of HF-whey-fed mice. We propose that enhanced urinary loss of TCA cycle metabolites drain available substrates for anabolic processes, such as lipogenesis, thereby leading to reduced lipid accretion in HF-whey-fed compared to HF-casein-fed mice."

Available findings indicate that decompression may induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules in the blood and tissues, which are associated with the macrophage polarization, and hyperbaric treatment may exert therapeutic effects on decompression related diseases via regulating these factors. Thus, we hypothesize that the polarization of circulating and/or resident macrophages is involved in the pathogenesis of decompression induced lung injury."

By transcriptional activation and other means, p53 is able to contribute to the regulation of glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, glutaminolysis, insulin sensitivity, nucleotide biosynthesis, mitochondrial integrity, fatty acid oxidation, antioxidant response, autophagy and mTOR signalling. The ability to positively and negatively regulate many of these pathways, combined with feedback signalling from these pathways to p53, demonstrates the reciprocal and flexible nature of the regulation, facilitating a diverse range of responses to metabolic stress. Intriguingly, metabolic stress triggers primarily an adaptive (rather than pro-apoptotic) p53 response, and p53 is emerging as an important regulator of metabolic homeostasis. A better understanding of how p53 coordinates metabolic adaptation will facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic targets and will also illuminate the wider role of p53 in human biology."

The present study aimed to identify a common set of genes which may serve as indicators of important molecular and cellular processes in breast, prostate and lung cancer. Six microarray gene expression profile datasets [GSE45827, GSE48984, GSE19804, GSE10072, GSE55945 and GSE26910 (two datasets for each cancer)] and one RNA-Seq expression dataset (GSE62944 including all three cancer types), were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in each individual cancer type using the LIMMA statistical package in R, and then a comparison of the resulting gene lists was performed to identify common DEGs across cancer types. This analysis was performed for microarray and RNA-Seq datasets individually, revealing a set of 62 and 1,290 differentially expressed genes respectively, which may be associated with the three cancers. Out of these genes, 44 were common to both analyses, and hence termed key genes. Gene Ontology functional annotation, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway mapping and literature citations were used to confirm the role of the key genes in cancer. Finally, the heterogeneity of expression of the key genes was explored using the I 2 statistic (meta package in R). The results demonstrated non-heterogeneous expression of 6 out of the 44 key genes, whereas the remaining genes exhibited significant heterogeneity in expression across microarray samples. In conclusion, the identified DEGs may play important roles in the pathogenesis of breast, prostate and lung cancer and may be used as biomarkers for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."

The effects of TAM on spatial and nonspatial learning and memory impairments induced by scopolamine and the brain tissues oxidative damage was investigated. The ovariectomized (OVX) rats were divided and treated: (1) Control (saline), (2) scopolamine (Sco; 2 mg/kg, 30 min before behavioral tests), (3\u20135) Sco-TAM 1, Sco-TAM 3 and Sco-TAM 10. TAM (1, 3 or 10 mg/kg; i.p.) was daily administered for 6 weeks. In Morris water maze (MWM), both the latency and traveled distance in the Sco-group were higher than control ( P < 0.001) while, in the Sco-TAM 10 group it was lower than Sco-group ( P < 0.05). In passive avoidance test, the latency to enter the dark compartment was higher than control ( P < 0.05 \u2013 P < 0.01). Pretreatment by all three doses of TAM prolonged the latency to enter the dark compartment compared to Sco-group ( P < 0.05 \u2013 P < 0.001). The brain tissues malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration was increased while, superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) decreased in the Sco-group compared to control ( P < 0.05 \u2013 P < 0.01). Pretreatment by TAM lowered the concentration of MDA while, increased SOD compared to Sco-group ( P < 0.05 \u2013 P < 0.001). It is suggested that TAM prevents spatial and nonspatial learning and memory impairments induced by scopolamine in OVX rats. The possible mechanism(s) might at least in part be due to protection against the brain tissues oxidative damage."

Plant species of subfamily Rauvolfioideae have long been used as herbal medicine by the majority of tribal people in Northeast (NE) India and at present holds mass effect on the society. Hence, there is an urgent need of correct taxonomic inventorization vis-\u00e0-vis species level molecular characterization of important medicinal plants. To test the efficiency of matK in species delineation like DNA barcoding in Rauvolfiadae (Apocynaceae). In this study, the core DNA barcode matK and trnH-psbA sequences are examined for differentiation of selected ethnomedicinal plants of Apocynaceae. DNA from young leaves of selected species was isolated, and matK gene (~800 bp) and trnH-psbA spacer (~450 bp) of Chloroplast DNA was amplified for species level identification. The ~758 bp matK sequence in comparison to the trnH-psbA showed easy amplification, alignment, and high level of discrimination value among the medicinal Rauvolfioidae species. Intergenic spacer trnH-psbA is also exhibited persistent problem in obtaining constant bidirectional sequences. Partial matK sequences exhibited 3 indels in multiple of 3 at 5 end. Evidently, generated matK sequences are clustered cohesively, with their conspecific Genbank sequences. However, repeat structures with AT-rich regions, possessing indels in multiple of 3, could be utilized as qualitative molecular markers in further studies both at the intra-specific and shallow inter-specific levels like the intergenic spacers of CpDNA. matK sequence information could help in correct species identification for medicinal plants of Rauvolfioideae."

        "abstract": "Portal hypertension and bleeding from gastroesophageal varices is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis. Portal hypertension is initiated by increased intrahepatic vascular resistance and a hyperdynamic circulatory state. The latter is characterized by a high cardiac output, increased total blood volume and splanchnic vasodilatation, resulting in increased mesenteric blood flow. Pharmacological manipulation of cirrhotic portal hypertension targets both the splanchnic and hepatic vascular beds. Drugs such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type receptor 1 blockers, which target the components of the classical renin angiotensin system (RAS), are expected to reduce intrahepatic vascular tone by reducing extracellular matrix deposition and vasoactivity of contractile cells and thereby improve portal hypertension. However, these drugs have been shown to produce significant off-target effects such as systemic hypotension and renal failure. Therefore, the current pharmacological mainstay in clinical practice to prevent variceal bleeding and improving patient survival by reducing portal pressure is non-selective -blockers (NSBBs). These NSBBs work by reducing cardiac output and splanchnic vasodilatation but most patients do not achieve an optimal therapeutic response and a significant proportion of patients are unable to tolerate these drugs. Although statins, used alone or in combination with NSBBs, have been shown to improve portal pressure and overall mortality in cirrhotic patients, further randomized clinical trials are warranted involving larger patient populations with clear clinical end points. On the other hand, recent findings from studies that have investigated the potential use of the blockers of the components of the alternate RAS provided compelling evidence that could lead to the development of drugs targeting the splanchnic vascular bed to inhibit splanchnic vasodilatation in portal hypertension. This review outlines the mechanisms related to the pathogenesis of portal hypertension and attempts to provide an update on currently available therapeutic approaches in the management of portal hypertension with special emphasis on how the alternate RAS could be manipulated in our search for development of safe, specific and effective novel therapies to treat portal hypertension in cirrhosis."

OCT volumes of the ONH were acquired from one eye of 10 healthy subjects. We processed all volumes with adaptive compensation to remove shadows and enhance deep tissue visibility. For each ONH, we identified the four most dissimilar pixel-intensity histograms, each of which was assumed to represent a tissue group. These four histograms formed a vector basis on which we \u2018projected' each OCT volume in order to generate four digitally stained volumes P1 to P4. Digital staining was also verified using a digital phantom, and compared with k-means clustering for three and four clusters. Digital staining was able to isolate three regions of interest from the proposed phantom. For the ONH, the digitally stained images P1 highlighted mostly connective tissues, as demonstrated through an excellent contrast increase across the anterior lamina cribrosa boundary (3.6 \u00b1 0.6 times). P2 highlighted the nerve fiber layer and the prelamina, P3 the remaining layers of the retina, and P4 the image background. Further, digital staining was able to separate ONH tissue layers that were not well separated by k-means clustering. We have described an algorithm that can digitally stain connective and neural tissues in OCT images of the ONH. Because connective and neural tissues are considerably altered in glaucoma, digital staining of the ONH tissues may be of interest in the clinical management of this pathology."

Canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling occurs through Smad2/3\u2013Smad4 complexes; however, recent in vitro studies suggest that elevated levels of TGF-\u03b2 may activate a novel mixed Smad complex (Smad2/3-Smad1/5/9), which is required for some of the pro-oncogenic activities of TGF-\u03b2. To determine if mixed Smad complexes are evident in vivo, we developed antibodies that can be used with a proximity ligation assay to detect either canonical or mixed Smad complexes in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections. We demonstrate high expression of mixed Smad complexes in the tissues from mice genetically engineered to express high levels of TGF-\u03b21. Mixed Smad complexes were also prominent in 15\u201316 day gestation mouse embryos and in breast cancer xenografts, suggesting important roles in embryonic development and tumorigenesis. In contrast, mixed Smad complexes were expressed at extremely low levels in normal adult mouse tissue, where canonical complexes were correspondingly higher. We show that this methodology can be used in archival patient samples and tissue microarrays, and we have developed an algorithm to quantitate the brightfield read-out. These methods will allow quantitative analysis of cell type-specific Smad signaling pathways in physiological and pathological processes."

We have performed a full annotation of the SARS-CoV genome sequences by using annotation programs publicly available or developed by ourselves. Totally, 21 open reading frames (ORFs) of genes or putative uncharacterized proteins (PUPs) were predicted. Seven PUPs had not been reported previously, and two of them were predicted to contain transmembrane regions. Eight ORFs partially overlapped with or embedded into those of known genes, revealing that the SARS-CoV genome is a small and compact one with overlapped coding regions. The most striking discovery is that an ORF locates on the minus strand. We have also annotated non-coding regions and identified the transcription regulating sequences (TRS) in the intergenic regions. The analysis of TRS supports the minus strand extending transcription mechanism of coronavirus. The SNP analysis of different isolates reveals that mutations of the sequences do not affect the prediction results of ORFs."

Thus, rapid identification of the bacteria and their antibiotic susceptibility profiles are crucial for reducing the mortality of patients with biliary tract infection. To identify bacterial species and antibiotic susceptibility for antibacterial therapy and analyze bile cultivation risk factors for increasing detection rates. This retrospective study was conducted from July 2008 to July 2017. In total, 1339 bile samples which were collected during therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopan-creatography or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiodrainage or other biliary surgeries or biliary drainage were obtained to characterize pathogen spectra, antibiotic susceptibility, and clinical features. Clinical data including age, sex, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, protopathies, and history of biliary tract diseases and surgeries were collated from hospital medical records. Species identification and initial drug susceptibility were further identi\ufb01ed by biochemical characterization using the VITEK 2 Compact test. Positive microbiological findings were observed in 738 samples. The most frequently encountered strains were gram-negative bacteria (74.94%), including Escherichia coli (37.78%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.96%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.29%). Bile bacteria were largely sensitive to carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and gentamicin. Gram-negative strains had low susceptibility to ceftriaxone, quinolones and ampicillin. Almost the same micro-organisms were present in patients with malignant and benign diseases. The number of samples with Klebsiella pneumoniae in the bile culture were significantly different between patients with malignant and benign diseases (55 vs 30; P = 0.019). Age ( P < 0.001), fever ( P < 0.001), history of biliary tract diseases and surgeries (both P < 0.001), benign disease ( P = 0.002), and the comorbidity chronic renal insufficiency ( P = 0.007) affected the positive rates of the bile samples. Gram-negative bacteria were the most commonly isolated biliary bacteria. We determined the major factors associated with positive detection rates. Microbiological analysis of bile samples allowed accurate antibiotic treatments."

We investigated and reviewed the thyroid function in all thalassemic patients attending the Pediatric Endocrine Clinic of Hamad Medical Center, Doha, Qatar during the last 10 years of follow-up. A total of 48 patients with \u03af-thalassemia major between 5 years and 18 years of age. Thyroid dysfunction was defined as follows: Overt hypothyroidism (low Free thyroxine [FT4] and increased thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] levels >5 \u03bcIU/ml); subclinical hypothyroidism (normal FT4, TSH between 5 \u03bcIU/ml and 10 \u03bcIU/ml) and central (secondary) hypothyroidism (low FT4 and normal or decreased TSH). A total of 48 patients (22 males and 26 females) completed a 12 year-period of follow-up. During this period, hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 17/48 (35%) of patients. There was no significant difference in the prevalence in males 7/22 (32%) versus females 10/26 (38%). Sixteen of the patients had hypothyroidism after the age of 10 years (94%). The prevalence of overt hypothyroidism had risen from 0% at the age of 7 years to 35% at the age of 18 years. None of the patients had high anti-thyroperoxidase antibody titers. Out of 17 patients, 13 patients with hypothyroidism had normal or low TSH level (not appropriately elevated) indicative of defective hypothalamic pituitary response to low FT4 (central hypothyroidism). Three patients (6.3%) had subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH between 5 uIU/ml and 10 uIU/ml and normal FT4). The general trend of FT4 level showed progressive decrease over the 12 years, whereas, TSH levels did not show a corresponding increase. These data suggested defective hypothalamic pituitary thyroid axis involving both TSH and FT4 sretion in patients with thalassemia major over time. There was a significant negative correlation between serum ferritin and FT4 ( r = \u22120.39, P = 0.007), but no correlation was found between ferritin and TSH. Worsening of thyroid function was observed in 35% of the studied thalassemic patients by the age of 18 years. The lack of proper increase of TSH in response to the low circulating levels of FT4 in 13/17 (76%) of these patients indicates a relatively high incidence of defective pituitary thyrotrophic function in these patients."

Diabetes management frameworks need to integrate a biopsychosocial, patient-centred approach. Despite increasing efforts in promotion and diabetes education, interventions integrating both physical and mental health components are still lacking in Malaysia. The Optimal Health Programme (OHP) offers an innovative biopsychosocial framework to promote overall well-being and self-efficacy, going beyond education alone and has been identified as relevant within the primary care system. Following a comprehensive cultural adaptation process, Malaysia\u2019s first OHP was developed under the name \u2018Pohon Sihat\u2019 (OHP). The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the mental health-based self-management and wellness programme in improving self-efficacy and well-being in primary care patients with diabetes mellitus. This biopsychosocial intervention randomised controlled trial will engage patients (n=156) diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from four primary healthcare clinics in Putrajaya. Participants will be randomised to either OHP plus treatment as usual. The 2-hour weekly sessions over five consecutive weeks, and 2-hour booster session post 3\u2009months will be facilitated by trained mental health practitioners and diabetes educators. Primary outcomes will include self-efficacy measures, while secondary outcomes will include well-being, anxiety, depression, self-care behaviours and haemoglobin A1c glucose test. Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, immediately postintervention, as well as at 3 months and 6 months postintervention. Where appropriate, intention-to-treat analyses will be performed. This study has ethics approval from the Medical Research and Ethics Committee, Ministry of Health Malaysia (NMRR-17-3426-38212). Study findings will be shared with the Ministry of Health Malaysia and participating healthcare clinics.

        "abstract": "Sweetgum trees are large, deciduous trees found in Asia and North America. Sweetgum trees are important resources for medicinal and other beneficial compounds. Many of the medicinal properties of sweetgum are derived from the resinous sap that exudes when the outer bark of the tree has been damaged. The sap, known as storax, has been used for centuries to treat common ailments such as skin problems, coughs, and ulcers. More recently, storax has proven to be a strong antimicrobial agent even against multidrug resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus . In addition to the sap, the leaves, bark, and seeds of sweetgum also possess beneficial compounds such as shikimic acid, a precursor to the production of oseltamivir phosphate, the active ingredient in Tamiflu\u00ae\u2013an antiviral drug effective against several influenza viruses. Other extracts derived from sweetgum trees have shown potential as antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, and chemopreventive agents. The compounds found in the extracts derived from sweetgum sap suppress hypertension in mice. Extracts from sweetgum seeds have anticonvulsant effects, which may make them suitable in the treatment of epilepsy. In addition to the potential medicinal uses of sweetgum extracts, the extracts of the sap possess antifungal activity against various phytopathogenic fungi and have been effective treatments for reducing nematodes and the yellow mosquito, Aedes aegypti , populations thus highlighting the potential of these extracts as environment-friendly pesticides and antifungal agents. The list of value-added products derived from sweetgum trees can be increased by continued research of this abundantly occurring tree."

We aim to systematically explore the association of COVID\u201019 severity and mortality rate with the history of cardiovascular diseases and/or other comorbidities and cardiac injury laboratory markers. The standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were applied to estimate pooled results from the 56 studies. The prognostic performance of cardiac markers for predicting adverse outcomes and to select the best cutoff threshold was estimated by ROC curve analysis. Decision tree analysis by combining cardiac markers with demographic and clinical features was applied to predict mortality and severity in COVID\u201019 patients. A meta\u2010analysis of 17,794 patients showed patients with high cardiac troponin I (OR=5.22, 95%CI=3.73\u20107.31, p <0.001) and AST levels (OR=3.64, 95%CI=2.84\u20104.66, p <0.001) were more likely to develop adverse outcomes. High troponin I >13.75 ng/L combined with either advanced age >60 years or elevated AST level >27.72 U/L was the best model to predict poor outcomes. COVID\u201019 severity and mortality are complicated by myocardial injury. Assessment of cardiac injury biomarkers may improve the identification of those patients at the highest risk and potentially lead to improved therapeutic approaches.

Interferon-free antiviral agents were used to treat 276 patients with chronic HCV1b infection, and changes in serum lipids of those who achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) were examined. The treatment regimen included 24 wk of daclatasvir plus asunaprevir (DCV + ASV) or 12 wk of sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir (SOF + LDV). SVR was achieved in 121 (85.8%) of 141 patients treated with DCV + ASV and 132 (97.8%) of 135 patients treated with SOF + LDV. In the two patient groups (DCV + ASV-SVR and SOF + LDV-SVR), serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides were measured at baseline during treatment and at 4 and 12 wk after treatment. Then, longitudinal changes in lipid profiles were analyzed. Serum levels of TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C were significantly increased throughout the observation period in both the DCV + ASV-SVR and SOF + LDV-SVR groups. During antivirus treatment, the increases in TC and LDL-C were significantly greater in the SOF + LDV-SVR group than in the DCV + ASV-SVR group ( P < 0.001). At 4 and 12 wk after the therapy, serum levels of TC and LDL-C were similar between the two groups and were significantly greater than those at baseline. Approximately 75%-80% of the increase in TC was derived from an increased LDL-C. In multiple regression analysis, the difference in therapy protocol (DCA + ASV or SOF + LDV) was an independent predictor that was significantly associated with the increase in TC and LDL-C at 4 wk of therapy. Serum cholesterol significantly increased during SOF + LDV treatment. After treatment, HCV elimination was associated with a similar increase in cholesterol regardless of the therapy protocol."

However the esophageal mucosa can also be targeted by some infectious, systemic or chemical conditions. Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease, characterized by eosinophilic infiltration in the mucosa. Esophageal localization of Crohn\u2019s disease is not very common, but it should always be considered in patients with inflammatory bowel disease complaining of upper digestive tract symptoms. There are also forms of infectious esophagitis ( e.g ., Herpes simplex virus or Candida albicans ) occurring in patients with a compromised immune system, either because of specific diseases or immunosuppressive therapies. Another kind of damage to esophageal mucosa is due to drug use (including oncologic chemotherapeutic regimens and radiotherapy) or caustic ingestion, usually of alkaline liquids, with colliquative necrosis and destruction of mucosa within a few seconds. Dysphagia is a predominant symptom in EoE, while infectious, drug-induced and caustic damages usually cause chest pain and odynophagia. Endoscopy can be useful for diagnosing esophagitis, although no specific pattern can be identified. In conclusion when a patient refers upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms and the diagnosis of gastro-esophageal reflux disease is not convincing we should always carefully investigate the patient\u2019s clinical history to consider possibilities other than the gastric refluxate."

Methanol extract was obtained from B. papyrifera stem bark and its sequential fractions (hexane, dichloromathane, ethyl acetate, butanol, and aqueous) were obtained by extraction in solvents with increasing polarity and were examined in RAW 264.7 cells. The secretion profiles of pro-inflammatory parameters, including nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) were found to be significantly reduced in 10-80 \u03bcg/ml dose ranges of n-hexane fraction (BP-H) from methanol extract of B. papyrifera stem bark. The expressions of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was also significantly inhibited by BP-H. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that BP-H treatment decreased LPS-induced iNOS mRNA expression in RAW 264.7 cells. The results suggest that the B. papyrifera stem bark has anti-inflammatory activity which inhibits the NO production and proinflammatory cytokines in RAW 264.7 cells. B. papyrifera stem bark might act as a potential therapeutic agent for inflammatory diseases."

Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating ceftaroline and other comparators in the treatment of acute bacterial infection in pediatric patients were included. The primary outcome was the clinical cure rate and the secondary outcome was the risk of adverse event. Results: Three RCTs were included. Overall, ceftaroline had a clinical cure rate at end of therapy (EOT) and test of cure (TOC) similar to comparators in the treatment of acute bacterial infection (at EOT, OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.88\u20134.25, I 2 =0%, and at TOC, OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.64\u20132.91, I 2 =14%).

Previous approaches to tumor immunotherapy have focused on modifying the immunosuppressive environment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, cytokine therapy, and other modalities with the intent to generate T-cell based anti-tumor immunity. We hypothesized that transformation of the suppressive ovarian cancer microenvironment could be achieved by introduction of the attenuated \u0394actA/\u0394inlB strain of Listeria monocytogenes. \u0394actA/\u0394inlB introduced into the microenvironment of the aggressive ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A murine ovarian carcinoma is preferentially phagocytosed by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and reprograms that population from one of suppression to immunostimulation. TAMs in the peritoneum upregulated their co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86, increased transcription of inflammatory cytokines, and downregulated transcription of suppressive effector molecules. Surprisingly, therapeutic benefit was not mediated by T- or NK-cell activity. \u0394actA/\u0394inlB-induced repolarization of TAMs activated direct tumor cell lysis via Nos2 production of nitric oxide. Modulation of the immunosuppressive nature of the ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A microenvironment, specifically by reprogramming of the TAM suppressive population from M2 to M1 polarization, is critical for our observed immune-mediated survival benefit."

In addition, mesangial cells were cultured in vitro and transfected with \u03b2-catenin siRNA to evaluate the effect of blocking Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling on cell apoptosis and the expression of markers of renal fibrosis. The results demonstrated that CKD rat kidney tissues exhibited moderate renal fibrosis and significantly increased expression levels of \u03b2-catenin and apoptosis associated proteins compared with sham-operated rats. In vitro , silencing of \u03b2-catenin by siRNA attenuated tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1-induced apoptosis and decreased mRNA expression levels of various markers of fibrosis, including fibronectin, transforming growth factor-\u03b2, and collagen I, III and IV.

A systematic review of the relevant literature and history was conducted. The term \u201celderly\u201d does not define age accurately and carries bias and prejudice that lead to harm through discriminatory practices, institutional prejudices, and \u201cageist\u201d policies in society and medicine. Doctors and healthcare providers seldom intentionally try to harm any patient, but might do so through unconscious anti-elderly bias. Studies indicate that medical students already demonstrate anti-elderly bias; researchers may lump patients aged 65 and over together, confounding specific information needed for individualized treatments; and out of unwarranted concern, medical and surgical treatments may be denied, despite minimal increased risk of mortality. When the cost of healthcare rises, it is the elderly against whom rationing is suggested. The term \u201celderly\u201d has no place in medicine. Anti-elderly health care rationing is as unethical as rationing targeted against any group. It is reverse paternalism to make rules that limit others\u2019 medical care, happiness, and life span without their consent. Medicine is the science and art of individual communication, evaluation and treatment. Once we deny care to any one group, we open the door to denial to others."

        "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe anxiety disorder that may develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. Recent clinical evidence has suggested the involvement of neurodegenerative pathology in the illness, particularly with brain imaging studies revealing a marked reduction in hippocampal volume. Of greater significance is that these anatomical changes appear to be positively correlated with the degree of cognitive deficit noted in these patients. Stress-induced increases in plasma cortisol have been implicated in this apparent atrophy. Although not definitive, clinical studies have observed a marked suppression of plasma cortisol in PTSD. The basis for hippocampal neurodegeneration and cognitive decline therefore remains unclear. Stress and glucocorticoids increase glutamate release, which is recognized as an important mediator of glucocorticoid-induced neurotoxicity. Recent preclinical studies have also noted that glutamate and nitric oxide (NO) play a causal role in anxiety-related behaviors. Because of the prominent role of NO in neuronal toxicity, cellular memory processes, and as a neuromodulator, nitrergic pathways may have an important role in stress-related hippocampal degenerative pathology and cognitive deficits seen in patients with PTSD. This paper reviews the preclinical evidence for involvement of the NO-pathway in PTSD, and emphasizes studies that have addressed these issues using time-dependent sensitization \u2013 a putative animal model of PTSD."

Emulsions (EMs) were prepared from 1% MF with 10% SO or FO at various NaCl concentration (0-0.5 M). The emulsifying ability index (EAI) of the EMs increased with increasing NaCl concentration for both oil types. Conversely, increasing NaCl manifested decrease in the emulsion stability index (ESI). In addition, creaming index (CI) also increased with NaCl concentration. From the microscopic observation, droplets of the EMs were more aggregated at relatively higher NaCl concentrations, especially for FO-EMs. All EMs had a gel-like structure owing to G' > G\" from the rheological analysis. Comparing the oil types, the emulsifying capacity of SO-EMs was more stable than that of FO-EMs at all NaCl concentrations as determined from the CI value and microscopic observation. Therefore, it can be concluded that SO-EMs and FO-EMs are more stable at relatively lower concentrations of NaCl. In addition, the dispersed stability of SO-EMs was better than that of FO-EMs at the same concentration of NaCl."

Infectious diseases impact African wild dogs ( Lycaon pictus ), but the nature and magnitude of this threat likely varies among populations according to different factors, such as the presence and prevalence of pathogens and land-use characteristics. We systematically evaluated these factors to assist development of locally appropriate strategies to mitigate disease risk. Wild dogs from 16 sites representing five unconnected populations were examined for rabies virus, canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus, canine coronavirus, and Babesia spp. exposure. Analyses revealed widespread exposure to viral pathogens, but Babesia was never detected. Exposure to CDV was associated with unprotected and protected-unfenced areas where wild dogs likely have a high probability of domestic dog contact and, in the case of protected-unfenced areas, likely reside amongst high wildlife densities. Our findings also suggest that domestic dog contact may increase rabies and coronavirus exposure risk. Therefore, domestic dogs may be a source of CDV, rabies and coronavirus, while wildlife may also play an important role in CDV transmission dynamics. Relatively high parvovirus seroprevalence across land-use types suggests that it might persist in the absence of spillover from domestic dogs. Should intervention be needed to control pathogens in wild dogs, efforts to prevent rabies and coronavirus exposure might be directed at reducing infection in the presumed domestic dog reservoir through vaccination. If prevention of CDV and parvovirus infections were deemed a management necessity, control of disease in domestic dogs may be insufficient to reduce transmission risks, and vaccination of wild dogs themselves may be the optimal strategy."

The data were analysed using Pearson correlation coefficient ( r ) as well as by a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. The study included 116 healthy males who satisfied the inclusion criteria. A Pearson correlation coefficient matrix demonstrated that all the four measures, age, BMI, hand length and forearm circumference, were significantly correlated with hand grip strength. Age had an inverse correlation with hand grip strength. The anthropometric measures of hand length, age and forearm circumference accounted for 44.2% (R 2 0.442) of the variation of the hand grip strength.

Analyses were done using both reversed-phase HPLC and also by counting radioactivity in various body compartments of rats. As a consequence of oral administration of 30 mg/kg of selegiline, its level in the stomach was extremely high (179.57 \u00b5g/g tissue through 54.67 \u00b5g/g at 15 min to 120 min), that is one magnitude higher than that in the serum level.

The relatively high tissue levels remained for 120 min monitoring. Selegiline levels in the brain (1.69 \u00b5g/g) and in the testes (1.88 \u00b5g/g) were also considerably higher than following intraperitoneal administration during the entire period of observation (15 to 120 min)."

This paper presents the protocol of nationwide population-based surveys of the Iranian COVID-19 Serological Surveillance (ICS) program.  Methods: The target population of the surveys is all individuals \u22656 years in Iran. Stratified random sampling will be used to select participants from those registered in the primary health care electronic record systems in Iran. The strata are the 31 provinces of the country, in which sampling will be done through simple random sampling. The sample size is estimated 858 individuals for each province (except for Tehran province, which is 2574) at the first survey. It will be recalculated for the next surveys based on the findings of the first survey. The participants will be invited by the community health workers to the safe blood sampling centers at the district level. After obtaining written informed consent, 10 mL of venous blood will be taken from the participants. The blood samples will be transferred to selected reference laboratories in order to test IgG and IgM antibodies against COVID-19 using an Iranian SARS-CoV-2 ELISA Kit (Pishtaz Teb). A serologically positive test is defined as a positive IgG, IgM, or both. After adjusting for the measurement error of the laboratory test, nonresponse bias, and sampling design, the prevalence of COVID-19 will be estimated at the provincial and national levels. Also, the approximate incidence rate of infection will be calculated based on the data of both consecutive surveys.  Conclusion: The implementation of these surveys will provide a comprehensive and clear picture of the magnitude of COVID-19 infection and its trend over time for health policymakers at the national and subnational levels."

The vacuoles were usually observed in a unit of the acinus, and the lesions were spread throughout the pancreas. These vacuoles contained weakly basophilic material that was positive for the periodic acid-Schiff reaction. Immunohistochemically, the vacuoles were positive for calreticulin antibody. Electron microscopy revealed globular dilatation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER). According to these findings, vacuolation of pancreatic acinar cells is caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins and enlargement of the rER."

When 0.01 nM N -ethylmaleimide was used to pre-block cellular thiols, the cellular uptake of M-GGLG liposomes was decreased to approximately 70% in HeLa, HCC1954, MDA-MB-468, and COS-7 cell lines. Moreover, inhibition of a thiol-related reductase such as protein disulfide isomerase resulted in a 15%\u201345% inhibition of the cellular uptake of M-GGLG liposomes, whereas GGLG liposomes were not influenced. Further, single and mixed inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and macropinocytosis did not efficiently inhibit the cellular uptake of M-GGLG liposomes. Using confocal microscopy, we verified that M-GGLG liposomes were localized partially in lysosomes after inhibition of the mentioned conventional endocytic pathways. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the mechanisms underlying the enhanced cellular uptake of liposomes by maleimide modification was thiol-mediated membrane trafficking, including endocytosis and energy-independent transport."

Such processes are referred to as structural confounding. If present, certain strata of social factors could hypothetically never be exposed to specific risk factors. This prohibits exchangeability across groups that is needed for meaningful causal inference. The objectives of this study were to: (1) develop and test the reliability and validity of composite scales for the measurement of social capital (SC), socioeconomic status (SES) and built environment (BE) and (2) to explore the possible roles of community level SC, SES and BE factors in studies of the aetiology of youth injury. A nationally representative sample of over 26\u2005000 Canadian students aged 11\u201315\u2005years. Scales describing these key factors were developed and validated via exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. We then used tabular analyses to explore structural confounding in our population. The proposed scales all demonstrated good psychometric properties. Despite variations in the number of adolescents across social and environmental strata, no evidence for the presence of structural confounding was detected in our data. Relationships between social capital and the occurrence of injuries in Canadian youth aged 11\u201316 can potentially be studied without consideration of structural confounding biases. Canada is a suitable place to disentangle the effects of different neighbourhood social and environmental exposures on occurrence of injuries and other outcomes in adolescent populations. Exchangeability is possible across exposure strata and therefore a meaningful multilevel regression analysis is feasible. However, more studies are needed to test the consistency of our findings in other populations and for different outcomes."

        "abstract": "Lower extremity amputation (LEA) is associated with a high risk of postoperative mortality. The effect of type of anesthesia on postoperative mortality has been studied in various surgeries. However, data for guiding the selection of optimal anesthesia for LEA are limited. This study aimed to determine the effect of anesthesia type on perioperative outcomes in patients with diabetes and/or peripheral vascular disease undergoing LEA. We reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent LEA at our center between September 2007 and August 2017, who were grouped according to use of general anesthesia (GA) or regional anesthesia (RA). Primary outcomes were 30-day and 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were postoperative morbidity, intraoperative events, postoperative intensive care unit admission, and postoperative length of stay. Propensity score-matched cohort design was used to control for potentially confounding factors, including patient demographics, comorbidities, medications, and type of surgery. Five hundred and nineteen patients (75% male, mean age 65 years) were identified to have received GA ( n =227) or RA ( n =292) for above-knee amputation (1.5%), below-knee amputation (16%), or more minor amputation (82.5%). Before propensity score matching, there was an association of GA with coronary artery disease (44% [GA] vs 34.5% [RA], p=0.028), peripheral arterial disease (73.1% vs 60.2%, p=0.002), and preoperative treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel (68.7% vs 55.1%, p=0.001; 63% vs 41.8%, p<0.001, respectively). Propensity score matching produced a cohort of 342 patients equally divided between GA and RA. There was no significant between-group difference in 30-day (3.5% vs 2.9%, p=0.737) or 90-day (6.4% vs 4.6%, p=0.474) mortality or postoperative morbidity. However, postoperative ICU admission (14.6% vs 7%, p=0.032), intraoperative hypotension (61.4% vs 14.6%, p<0.001), and vasopressor use (52% vs 14%, p<0.001) were more common with GA than with RA. Type of anesthesia did not significantly affect mortality or morbidity after LEA. However, intraoperative hypotension, vasopressor use, and postoperative ICU admission rates were lower with RA."

        "abstract": "Gastric cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Resistance to chemotherapy is a significant barrier for effective cancer treatment. Here, we identified miR-185 to be a contributor to chemosensitivity in gastric cancer. We observed low levels of miR-185 in gastric cancer cell lines and clinical tissues, compared with gastric epithelium cell line and noncancerous tissues. Furthermore, enforced expression of miR-185 increased the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to low-dose chemotherapeutic agents, which alone cannot trigger significant apoptosis. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous miR-185 prevented high-dose chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In elucidating the molecular mechanism by which miR-185 participated in the regulation of chemosensitivity in gastric cancer, we discovered that apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC) is a direct target of miR-185. The role of miR-185 was confirmed in gastric tumor xenograft model. The growth of established tumors was suppressed by a combination therapy using enforced miR-185 expression and a low dose of anticancer drugs. Finally, we found that RUNX3 (Runt-related transcription factor) was involved in the activation of miR-185 at the transcriptional level. Taken together, our results reveal that RUNX3, miR-185 and ARC regulate the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to chemotherapy."

        "abstract": "Safely managed water supply and wastewater services have been playing key roles in maintaining good water environmental quality, stopping the spread of disease and protecting public health during infectious outbreaks, including of ongoing coronavirus outbreak 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2. Recently, there are a growing number of scientific research findings, and reports around the world, which revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is detected in untreated domestic and hospital wastewater, and it is spreading through human feces. In order to address this emerging challenge and minimize associated human health risks, it is essential to have a better understanding on possible routes of SARS-CoV-2 infections and contamination across water and wastewater service chain based on recent scientific findings. Consequently, it will assist local authorities in identifying and implementing appropriate preventive countermeasures to stop possible COVID-19 transmission. Roles of using regular viral surveillance in untreated wastewater in the affected areas have also been highlighted in the chapter, as an effective early-warning tool, for revealing true scale of the coronavirus outbreak, trends of the pandemic, as well as providing early warnings to the community. If SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively monitored in infected communities at an early stage through wastewater-based epidemiology, together with results from clinical diagnostic testing or even in the areas where clinical surveillance is poor, effective interventions and preparedness actions can be taken as early as possible to restrict the movements of infected population, as well as to minimize the pathogen spread and threat to public health."

For this experiment, 80 wild goldfish were divided into four experimental groups: 0.3 mg/L of cadmium and 0 mg/L of taurine (Group I), 0.3 mg/L of cadmium and 20 mg/kg of taurine (Group II), 0.3 mg/L of cadmium and 40 mg/L of taurine (Group III), and 0.3 mg/L of cadmium and 80 mg/L of taurine (Group IV). The results were as follows: The cadmium concentration in muscle tissue of wild goldfish was 0.65-3.21 mg/kg wet wt in Group I, whereas it decreased in Group IV. Levels of cadmium in gill tissue of wild goldfish were 16.57-42.39 mg/kg wet wt in Group I, 15.23-43.01 mg/kg wet wt in Group II, 15.11-39.56 mg/kg wet wt in Group III, and 13.15-38.55 mg/kg wet wt in Group IV ( P < 0.05), suggesting that the cadmium concentration decreased in the experimental groups compared to control. The cadmium concentration in bone tissue of wild goldfish after 28 days was 0.52-9.75 mg/kg in Group II, whereas it increased in Group III ( P < 0.05). In conclusion, taurine may have a preventive effect against cadmium accumulation in biological tissues."

Despite the climate warming, cold climatic conditions will prevail in circumpolar areas and contribute to adverse health effects. Frostbite is a freezing injury where localized damage affects the skin and other tissues. It occurs during occupational or leisure-time activities and is common in the general population among men and women of various ages. Industries of the circumpolar areas where frostbite occurs frequently include transportation, mining, oil, and gas industry, construction, agriculture, and military operations. Cold injuries may also occur during leisure-time activities involving substantial cold exposure, such as mountaineering, skiing, and snowmobiling. Accidental situations (occupational, leisure time) often contribute to adverse cooling and cold injuries. Several environmental (temperature, wind, wetness, cold objects, and altitude) and individual (behavior, health, and physiology) predisposing factors are connected with frostbite injuries. Vulnerable populations include those having a chronic disease (cardiovascular, diabetes, and depression), children and the elderly, or homeless people. Frostbite results in sequelae causing different types of discomfort and functional limitations that may persist for years. A frostbite injury is preventable, and hence, unacceptable from a public health perspective. Appropriate cold risk management includes awareness of the adverse effects of cold, individual adjustment of cold exposure and clothing, or in occupational context different organizational and technical measures. In addition, vulnerable population groups need customized information and care for proper prevention of frostbites."

To systematically review, critically appraise and synthesize evidence on use of stem cells from autologous stem cells from bone marrow aspirate, adipose, or any other autologous sources for fusion in the cervical spine compared with other graft materials. A systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE was conducted for literature published through October 31, 2018 and through February 20, 2020 for EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov comparing autologous cell sources for cervical spine fusion to other graft options. From 36 potentially relevant citations identified, 10 studies on cervical fusion met the inclusion criteria set a priori. Two retrospective cohort studies, one comparing cancellous bone marrow (CBM) versus hydroxyapatite (HA) and the other bone marrow aspirate (BMA) combined with autograft and HA versus autograft and HA alone, were identified. No statistical differences were seen between groups in either study for improvement in function, symptoms, or fusion; however, in the study evaluating BMA, the authors reported a statistically greater fusion rate and probability of fusion over time in the BMA versus the non-BMA group. Across case series evaluating BMA, authors reported improved function and pain and fusion ranged from 84% to 100% across the studies. In general, complications were poorly reported. The overall quality (strength) of evidence of effectiveness and safety of autologous BMA for cervical arthrodesis in the current available literature was very low. Based on currently available data, firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness or safety of BMA in cervical fusions cannot be made."

During the southwest monsoon season, it normally occurs along with haze phenomenon that every year will hit Southeast Asia. This condition will aggravate with high acidic particles in the atmosphere due to the prolonged drought. The analysed parameters which involved pH, anions (NO 3 - , SO 4 2- and Cl \u2212 ) and cations (Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , Na + and K + ) were analysed using pH meter, Hach DR 2800, argentometric method and ICP-OES. From the findings, it showed that acid rain occurred during the southwest monsoon season with the range of pH values from 4.95 \u00b1 0.13 to 6.40 \u00b1 0.03 and the total average of pH 5.71 \u00b1 0.32. Anions NO 3 - , SO 4 2- and Cl \u2212 were found to be the dominant compositions of the acid rain occurrences with higher concentrations detected. In overall, rural area recorded with higher acidity of precipitation at total average of pH 5.54 \u00b1 0.39 compared to urban area at pH 5.77 \u00b1 0.26. Rural area surprisingly recorded higher frequency occurrences of acid rain with pH lesser than 5.6 and below compared to urban area. As for public health and safety, all rainwater samples during the acid rain event were found exceeded the allowable limits of NWQS and WHO standards, that shown not suitable for skin contact, recreational purposes even for drinking purposes.

The diagnosis is primarily made based on detailed history and accurate clinical examination. The delay in its diagnosis has not yet been described in the pediatric and adolescent population. To identify and characterize misdiagnosed cases of PAIS in pediatric and adolescent patients. This descriptive prospective study at a tertiary children\u2019s hospital included patients \u2264 18 years who underwent posterior ankle arthroscopy after presenting with chronic posterior ankle pain after being diagnosed with PAIS. Collected data included: Demographics, prior diagnoses and treatments, providers seen, time to diagnosis from presentation, and prior imaging obtained. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain and American Orthopedic Foot Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scores were noted at initial presentation and follow-up. 35 patients (46 ankles) with average age of 13 years had an average 19 mo (range 0-60 mo) delay in diagnosis from initial presentation. 25 (71%) patients had previously seen multiple medical providers and were given multiple other diagnoses. All 46 (100%) ankles had tenderness to palpation over the posterior ankle joint. Radiographs were reported normal in 31/42 (72%) exams. In 32 ankles who underwent MRI, the most common findings included os trigonum (47%)/Stieda process (47%). Conservative treatment had already been attempted in all patients. Ankle impingement pathology was confirmed during arthroscopy in 46 (100%) ankles. At an average follow-up of 13.1 mo, there was an improvement of VAS (pre-op 7.0 to post-op 1.2) and AOFAS scores (pre-op 65.1 to post-op 94). This is the first study which shows that PAIS is a clinically misdiagnosed cause of posterior ankle pain in pediatric and adolescent population; an increased awareness about this diagnosis is needed amongst providers treating young patients."

        "abstract": "Symptomatic cartilage defects of the knee are commonly surgically treated by microfracture (MFX) or matrix-associated chondrocyte implantation (M-ACI). Several randomized controlled trials have compared MFX and M-ACI, showing a tendency to lower reoperation rates for M-ACI, but results vary widely between studies. To compare reoperation rates after MFX and M-ACI in cartilage defects of the knee outside clinical trials in a representative sample of the population. Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. This study was based on anonymized, population-representative claims data of 4 million insured persons in Germany. Patients who underwent MFX or M-ACI for cartilage defects of the knee with a follow-up of 2 years were compared. The primary endpoint was the need for a reoperation, defined as a claim for a second surgical procedure from the same patient at the knee joint (27 procedure codes), meniscus and cartilage (35 procedure codes), or patella (102 procedure codes) or the need for knee replacement (11 procedure codes). Group comparisons were performed using log-rank tests, with a 2-sided P value of <.05 to indicate significance. For adjusted analysis, propensity score matching was applied. Age, sex, comedications, and comorbidities were used as matching parameters. A total of 6425 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 6273 treated with MFX and 152 treated with M-ACI (mean age, 53 and 36 years, respectively). In the 2 years after treatment, 1271 patients in the MFX group needed a reoperation compared with 19 in the M-ACI group (20.3% vs 12.5%, respectively; P = .0199). For adjusted analysis after propensity score matching, 127 patients per group were analyzed. Their mean age was 37 years. At the end of the second follow-up year, 28 and 16 patients needed reoperations in the MFX and M-ACI groups, respectively (22.0% vs 12.6%, respectively; P = .0498). This study used a representative sample of the population and a broad definition of a reoperation, thus expanding evidence from clinical trials. We found a significant advantage of M-ACI in reoperation rates 2 years after treatment. After adjusting for age, sex, comedications, and comorbidities, M-ACI still showed significantly lower reoperation rates after 2 years."

Two subtypes of transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family, i.e. TRPC3 and TRPM2, are potential candidates involved in calcium signaling and implicated in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. This study was designed to investigate whether mood stabilizers such as lithium and valproate affect the expression of TRPC3 and TRPM2. Rats were treated with intraperitoneal injections of lithium (2 mEq/kg b.i.d.) or valproate (300 mg/kg b.i.d.) acutely (for 24 h) or chronically (for 4 weeks). The changes in mRNA and protein levels of TRPC3 and TRPM2 were measured with real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The chronic administration of lithium and valproate significantly reduced levels of TRPC3 by 19.7% and 19.3%, respectively. No change was detected in the mRNA level of this channel. Neither acute nor chronic treatment with lithium or valproate had any effect on TRPM2 levels. The results suggest that downregulation of the TRPC3 channel is an important shared mechanism by which lithium and valproate can modulate calcium disturbances, whereas the TRPM2 channel does not appear to be affected by mood stabilizers, at least under non stressed conditions."

Moreover, the participant\u2019s Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) and Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS) scores were assessed. Both the WBVAO and WBV groups demonstrated significant increases in the scores of FTSTS test, GMFM (D and E dimensions), PBS, TUG test, 6MWT, and TUDS test. The WBVAO group improved more significantly compared to the WBV group based on the scores of the FTSTS test, GMFM (D dimension), PBS, 6MWT, and TUDS test. WBV combined with action observation improved lower extremity functional strength, gross motor function, and balance and gait in children with cerebral palsy. These results suggest that WBV combined with action observation is both feasible and suitable for individuals with cerebral palsy."

The identification and management of symptoms that may affect nutritional status is often reliant upon the family carer. This interpretative phenomenological study aimed to explore the experiences and perceptions of the nutritional care of people living with dementia at home from the perspectives of the family members who support them. Semi-structured interviews were conducted between October 2017 and February 2018. Participants were also asked to keep a diary of experiences for two weeks before the interview. An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis approach was used throughout. Findings: Eight participants, with a mean age of 69.6 years residing in South West England were recruited and represented a range of familial roles. Following analysis, three superordinate themes were identified: \u2018becoming carer and cook\u2019, \u2018changing role and relationships\u2019 and \u2018emotional eating\u2019. Family carers make food and drink decisions daily, and feel a duty to take on the responsibility for food shopping and cooking. They are conscious about \u2018doing the right thing\u2019 when it comes to providing nutritional care, and some feel uncertain about the food choices they are making, particularly regarding a reliance on convenience foods. Changes in appetite, food preferences and mealtime habits related to dementia can lead to disruption affecting the dyad. It is important that family carers and people living at home with dementia are provided with adequate support regarding identifying nutritional risks, making appropriate food and drink choices and preventing the risk of malnutrition in the dyad."

There were three women and four men with an average age of 54.9\u00a0years (range 28\u201389\u00a0years). The mean follow-up period was 15.4\u00a0months (range 4\u201329\u00a0months). The dominant hand was involved in six (85.7%) patients. In a retrospective clinical study, the following criteria were evaluated: (1) etiology of the defect, (2) time of reconstruction (primary vs. delayed), (3) survival rate of flap, (4) sensory function (Semmes\u2013Weinstein monofilaments, static 2-PD, pain, cortical reorientation), (5) TAM measured with the Kapandji index, and (6) subjective patient satisfaction (SF 36). Four patients presented with trauma, two patients with defects after tumor resection and one with infection of the thumb. The flap was used for immediate reconstruction in three (42.9%) patients and for delayed reconstruction in four (57.1%) patients. Delayed reconstruction was performed 4.75 (1\u201312) months after initial trauma or first surgery. The donor area was grafted with full-thickness skin grafts in all cases. All flaps survived. The mean SWMF was 3.31\u00a0g and average statis 2-PD over the flap was 10.57\u00a0mm. Pain at the flap scored 3.71 over 10 and at the donor site 2.17 over 10. Paresthesia at the flap scored 0.57 over 4 and at the donor site 0.33 over 4. Complete cortical reorientation was only seen in one patient. The mean Kapandji score of the reconstructed thumb was 7.43 over 10. Using the SF-36, mean physical health of the patients scored 66.88% and mean mental health scored 70.55%. Disturbing pain and paresthesia of the flap are exceptional. The static 2-PD is more than 10\u00a0mm, and is clinically over the limit. Cortical reorientation was incomplete in all but one patient. Touch on thumb is felt on the dorsum of the index finger; however, sensation is not disturbing or interfering with the patient\u2019s activities. Foucher described the technique d\u00e9branchement\u2013r\u00e9branchement in order to improve this problem. The postoperative total amount of motion of the reconstructed thumb was very good. The results demonstrated that the FDMCA flap has a constant anatomy and easy dissection. It has a low donor site morbidity if FTSG is used. It also shows good functional and aesthetic results. Therefore, the FDMCA flap is a first treatment of choice for defects of the proximal phalanx and proximal part of the distal phalanx of the thumb."

        "abstract": "This article reviews the topic of how to identify and develop a removable partial denture (RPD) path of placement, and provides a literature review of the concept of the RPD path of placement, also known as the path of insertion. An optimal RPD path of placement, guided by mutually parallel guide planes, ensures that the RPD flanges fit intimately over edentulous ridge structures and that the framework fits intimately with guide plane surfaces, which prevents food collecting empty spaces between the intaglio surface of the framework and intraoral surfaces, and ensures that RPD clasps engage adequate numbers of tooth undercuts to ensure RPD retention. The article covers topics such as the causes of obstructions to RPD intra-oral seating, the causes of food collecting empty spaces that may exist around an RPD, and how to identify if a guide plane is parallel with the projected RPD path of placement. The article presents a method of using a surgical operating microscope, or high magnification (6-8x or greater) binocular surgical loupes telescopes, combined with co-axial illumination, to identify a preliminary path of placement for an arch. This preliminary path of placement concept may help to guide a dentist or a dental laboratory technician when surveying a master cast of the arch to develop an RPD path of placement, or in verifying that intra-oral contouring has aligned teeth surfaces optimally with the RPD path of placement. In dentistry, a well-fitting RPD reduces long-term periodontal or structural damage to abutment teeth."

        "abstract": "The long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proven to be involved in the development of alcoholic hepatitis (AH), which has been regarded as a severe form of acute liver injury with a high mortality rate. Through the GEO database, the differentially expressed LINC01093 and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were identified in AH. Then, to clarify their specific role and underlying mechanism in AH, we constructed an AH mouse model by using Lieber-Decarli alcoholic feed. It was found that LINC01093 was poorly expressed and ICAM-1 was highly expressed in AH mice. After that, the interactions among LINC01093, ICAM-1, and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway were explored, which verified that LINC01093 could target ICAM-1 and inhibit the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Finally, after the hepatocytes were isolated from AH mice, the expression of LINC01093 was up- or downregulated or that of ICAM-1 was silenced to evaluate their effect on cell viability and apoptosis. The corresponding results demonstrated that after overexpression of LINC01093 or silencing of ICAM-1, cell viability was increased and cell apoptosis was reduced in the hepatocytes of AH mice. Moreover, the silencing of LINC01093 was observed to inhibit the viability and promote the apoptosis of hepatocytes of AH mice. Altogether, these results provide evidence that overexpression of LINC01093 could effectively suppress hepatocyte apoptosis and promote proliferation by inhibiting the ICAM-1-mediated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, thus playing a functional role in AH and hepatic fibrosis."

Data treatment effected the estimation of community richness over a 6-year period, whereby 8794 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified using single-linkage preclustering and 21\u2009130 OTUs were identified by denoising the data. The Alphaproteobacteria were the most abundant Class, and the most frequently recorded OTUs were members of the Rickettsiales (SAR 11) and Rhodobacteriales . This near-surface ocean bacterial community showed strong repeatable seasonal patterns, which were defined by winter peaks in diversity across all years. Environmental variables explained far more variation in seasonally predictable bacteria than did data on protists or metazoan biomass. Change in day length alone explains >65% of the variance in community diversity. The results suggested that seasonal changes in environmental variables are more important than trophic interactions. Interestingly, microbial association network analysis showed that correlations in abundance were stronger within bacterial taxa rather than between bacteria and eukaryotes, or between bacteria and environmental variables."

        "abstract": "During neural development, growing axons navigate over long distances to reach their targets. A critical step in this process is the regulation of its surface receptors on the axon\u2019s growth cone in response to environmental cues. We focus on how the UNC-5 receptor in Ca enorhabditis elegans motor axons is regulated during axon repulsion. By combining C. elegans genetics, biochemistry, and imaging, we found that MAX-1 SUMOylation and AP-3 complex have significant roles in UNC-5\u2013mediated axon repulsion. Our findings reveal how SUMOylation and AP-3\u2013mediated trafficking and degradation interact to help the growing axon find its final target. During neural development, growing axons express specific surface receptors in response to various environmental guidance cues. These axon guidance receptors are regulated through intracellular trafficking and degradation to enable navigating axons to reach their targets. In Caenorhabditis elegans , the UNC-5 receptor is necessary for dorsal migration of developing motor axons. We previously found that MAX-1 is required for UNC-5\u2013mediated axon repulsion, but its mechanism of action remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that UNC-5\u2013mediated axon repulsion in C. elegans motor axons requires both max-1 SUMOylation and the AP-3 complex \u03b2 subunit gene, apb-3 . Genetic interaction studies show that max-1 is SUMOylated by gei-17/PIAS1 and acts upstream of apb-3 . Biochemical analysis suggests that constitutive interaction of MAX-1 and UNC-5 receptor is weakened by MAX-1 SUMOylation and by the presence of APB-3, a competitive interactor with UNC-5. Overexpression of APB-3 reroutes the trafficking of UNC-5 receptor into the lysosome for protein degradation. In vivo fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments shows that MAX-1 SUMOylation and APB-3 are required for proper trafficking of UNC-5 receptor in the axon. Our results demonstrate that SUMOylation of MAX-1 plays an important role in regulating AP-3\u2013mediated trafficking and degradation of UNC-5 receptors during axon guidance."

IPE cysts classically remain stable without need for intervention. Iris stromal cyst, especially those in newborns, usually requires therapy of aspiration, possibly with alcohol-induced sclerosis, or surgical resection. The solid tumors included melanocytic and nonmelanocytic lesions. The melanocytic iris tumors include freckle, nevus (including melanocytoma), Lisch nodule, and melanoma. Information from a tertiary referral center revealed that transformation of suspicious iris nevus to melanoma occurred in 4% by 10 years and 11% by 20 years. Risk factors for transformation of iris nevus to melanoma can be remembered using the ABCDEF guide as follows: A=age young (<40 years), B=blood (hyphema) in anterior chamber, C=clock hour of mass inferiorly, D=diffuse configuration, E=ectropion, F=feathery margins. The most powerful factors are diffuse growth pattern and hyphema. Tumor seeding into the anterior chamber angle and onto the iris stroma are also important. The nonmelanocytic iris tumors are relatively uncommon and included categories of choristomatous, vascular, fibrous, neural, myogenic, epithelial, xanthomatous, metastatic, lymphoid, leukemic, secondary, and non-neoplastic simulators. Overall, the most common diagnoses in a clinical series include nevus, IPE cyst, and melanoma. In summary, iris tumors comprise a wide spectrum including mostly iris nevus, IPE cyst, and iris melanoma. Risk factors estimating transformation of iris nevus to melanoma can be remembered by the ABCDEF guide."

Sixty extracted human maxillary first premolars prepared for standardized Class I cavities (4 mm \u00d7 2 mm \u00d7 2 mm) were randomly divided into three groups. Group A ( n = 20) was filled with Filtek Z250 (Methacrylate) using single bond universal total etching technique, Group B ( n = 20) was filled with Filtek Z250 XT (Methacrylate) using single bond universal self-etching technique and Group C ( n = 20) restored with Filtek P90 (Silorane) with dedicated two-step self-etching prime and bond adhesive system (P90 system adhesive). Teeth were subjected to thermocycling regime (500\u00d7, 5-55\u00b0C), and dye penetration by immersing in 2% methylene blue for 24 h. Tooth sectioning was performed, and extent of the dye penetration was scored based on dye penetration scale to evaluate the microleakage. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and inferential statistics of Kruskal\u2013Wallis test to compare the mean ranks between groups. There was no significant difference observed for microleakage among the three composite materials tested in the present study. However, the cavities restored with silorane (Filtek P90) based composite displayed higher microleakage than the Filtek Z250, Z250 XT. All the restorative systems tested in this study exhibited microleakage, but the silorane technology showed more microleakage when compared to the methacrylate-based composite systems."

The association between headache and epilepsy commonly occurs in all types of epilepsy and not only in occipital epilepsy. Generally, peri-ictal headache is often neglected, regardless of its severity, because patients are more concerned about their seizures. Altered cerebral cortex excitability may be the link between these two conditions and photosensitivity shows this. The physician should bear this association in mind when dealing with epileptic and migraine patients so as to be able to offer such patients an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment; this should be borne in mind when declaring epileptic patients \u2018seizure free\u2019. To date neither the International Headache Society nor the International League against Epilepsy mention that headache/migraine may, on occasion, be the sole ictal epileptic manifestation.

        "abstract": "The sweet taste receptors present in the taste buds are heterodimers comprised of T1R2 and T1R3. This receptor is also expressed in pancreatic \u03b2-cells. When the expression of receptor subunits is determined in \u03b2-cells by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, the mRNA expression level of T1R2 is extremely low compared to that of T1R3. In fact, the expression of T1R2 is undetectable at the protein level. Furthermore, knockdown of T1R2 does not affect the effect of sweet molecules, whereas knockdown of T1R3 markedly attenuates the effect of sweet molecules. Consequently, a homodimer of T1R3 functions as a receptor sensing sweet molecules in \u03b2-cells, which we designate as sweet taste-sensing receptors (STSRs). Various sweet molecules activate STSR in \u03b2-cells and augment insulin secretion. With regard to intracellular signals, sweet molecules act on STSRs and increase cytoplasmic Ca 2+ and/or cyclic AMP (cAMP). Specifically, when an STSR is stimulated by one of four different sweet molecules (sucralose, acesulfame potassium, sodium saccharin, or glycyrrhizin), distinct signaling pathways are activated. Patterns of changes in cytoplasmic Ca 2+ and/or cAMP induced by these sweet molecules are all different from each other. Hence, sweet molecules activate STSRs by acting as biased agonists."

The mechanisms mediating these defects remain largely unknown at present, thus limiting the development of therapeutic approaches. Using a wound healing model, we here investigate the mechanisms by which IR exposure limits skin regeneration. Our data show that induction of the stromal cell-derived growth factor 1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1) is severely impaired in the wounded skin of irradiated, compared to non-irradiated, mice. Hence, we evaluated the potential of bone marrow-derived multipotent stromal cells (MSCs), which secrete high levels of SDF-1\u03b1, to improve skin regeneration in irradiated mice. Injection of MSCs into the wound margin led to remarkable enhancement of skin healing in mice exposed to IR. Injection of irradiated MSCs into the wound periphery of non-irradiated mice delayed wound closure, also suggesting an important role for the stromal microenvironment in skin repair. The beneficial actions of MSCs were mainly paracrine, as the cells did not differentiate into keratinocytes. Specific knockdown of SDF-1\u03b1 expression led to drastically reduced efficiency of MSCs in improving wound closure, indicating that SDF-1\u03b1 secretion by MSCs is largely responsible for their beneficial action. We also found that one mechanism by which SDF-1\u03b1 enhances wound closure likely involves increased skin vascularization. Our findings collectively indicate that SDF-1\u03b1 is an important deregulated cytokine in irradiated wounded skin, and that the decline in tissue regeneration potential following IR can be reversed, given adequate microenvironmental support"

We retrospectively analyzed real-world data from the HealthStat general practice database to evaluate treatment patterns among patients with COPD in New Zealand who initiated multiple-inhaler triple therapy (MITT): inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) + long-acting muscarinic antagonist + long-acting \u03b2 2 -agonist (LABA). Our main objective described treatment patterns (class, duration, modification, persistence, and adherence) and characteristics of patients with COPD initiating MITT between 1 May 2016 and 30 April 2017, with 12-months\u2019 follow-up. We also assessed the number of patients receiving MITT between 2015 and 2017, among a larger patient population receiving long-acting bronchodilator and ICS-containing therapies. Of 6249 eligible patients, 421 (mean age 67.3 years; mean number\u00a0exacerbations at baseline 1.8) initiated MITT: 59.1% received combination ICS/LABA therapy prior to MITT initiation, and median treatment duration prior to MITT initiation was 350 days. Overall, 33.5% of patients remained on index treatment for 12 months. Of the remaining patients who modified treatment (on average at 144.4 days), those who had a direct switch (24.9%) or retreatment (13.5%) remained on MITT, 19.7% of patients stepped down to mono/dual therapy, and 8.3% discontinued treatment. Mean (standard deviation) persistence to any MITT over 12 months was 47.3 (50.0), and 53.4% of patients were considered adherent to MITT. Total proportions of patients receiving long-acting bronchodilator therapy and MITT increased between 2015 and 2017. Most patients with COPD in New Zealand who initiated MITT had characteristics appropriate for triple therapy prescription, suggesting prescription behavior among general practitioners was largely consistent with treatment guidelines. Our findings may help optimize treatment decisions, with a focus on improving long-term triple therapy persistence and adherence."

However, the mechanism(s) of its function in global regulation is unknown. The current study investigates the molecular mechanism by which 25HC3S functions as an endogenous epigenetic regulator. To study the effects of oxysterols/sterol sulfates on epigenetic modulators, 12 recombinant epigenetic enzymes were used to determine whether 25HC3S acts as their endogenous ligand. The enzyme kinetic study demonstrated that 25HC3S specifically inhibited DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b with IC 50 of 4.04, 3.03, and 9.05\u00a0\u00d7 10 \u22126 M, respectively. In human hepatocytes, high glucose induces lipid accumulation by increasing promoter CpG methylation of key genes involved in development of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases. Using this model, whole genome bisulfate sequencing analysis demonstrated that 25HC3S converts the 5m CpG to CpG in the promoter regions of 1,074 genes. In addition, we observed increased expression of the demethylated genes, which are involved in the master signaling pathways, including MAPK-ERK, calcium-AMP-activated protein kinase, and type II diabetes mellitus pathways. mRNA array analysis showed that the upregulated genes encoded for key elements of cell survival; conversely, downregulated genes encoded for key enzymes that decrease lipid biosynthesis. Taken together, our results indicate that the expression of these key elements and enzymes are regulated by the demethylated signaling pathways. We summarized that 25HC3S DNA demethylation of 5m CpG in promoter regions is a potent regulatory mechanism."

        "abstract": " Vitex agnus\u2010castus L. (Lamiaceae) is a medicinal plant historically used throughout the Mediterranean region to treat menstrual cycle disorders, and is still used today as a clinically effective treatment for premenstrual syndrome. The pharmaceutical activity of the plant extract is linked to its ability to lower prolactin levels. This feature has been attributed to the presence of dopaminergic diterpenoids that can bind to dopamine receptors in the pituitary gland. Phytochemical analyses of V. agnus\u2010castus show that it contains an enormous array of structurally related diterpenoids and, as such, holds potential as a rich source of new dopaminergic drugs. The present work investigated the localisation and biosynthesis of diterpenoids in V. agnus\u2010castus . With the assistance of matrix\u2010assisted laser desorption ionisation\u2010mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI\u2010MSI), diterpenoids were localised to trichomes on the surface of fruit and leaves. Analysis of a trichome\u2010specific transcriptome database, coupled with expression studies, identified seven candidate genes involved in diterpenoid biosynthesis: three class II diterpene synthases (diTPSs); three class I diTPSs; and a cytochrome P450 (CYP). Combinatorial assays of the diTPSs resulted in the formation of a range of different diterpenes that can account for several of the backbones of bioactive diterpenoids observed in V. agnus\u2010castus . The identified CYP, Vac CYP76BK1, was found to catalyse 16\u2010hydroxylation of the diol\u2010diterpene, peregrinol, to labd\u201013 Z \u2010ene\u20109,15,16\u2010triol when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Notably, this product is a potential intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway towards bioactive furan\u2010 and lactone\u2010containing diterpenoids that are present in this species. Furan and lactone diterpenoids of the medicinal plant, Vitex agnus\u2010castus , have received interest for their potential as new dopaminergic drugs. Through the application of MADLI \u2010 MS imaging, targeted transcriptomics and enzyme functional characterisation, we report the identification of six diterpene synthases and a cytochrome P450, that in different combinations, catalyse steps towards their biosynthesis."

The organic farms had produced \u2018certified\u2019 milk for at least 2 years. On two occasions, with a 1-year interval, 699 serum samples from 624 peri-parturient cows were tested by ELISA for antibodies to BCV and BRSV. Accompanying data relating to the sampled animals were collected in order to identify potential factors associated with increased antibody prevalence. The antibody prevalence was high at both sampling times with approximately 85% and 80% of animals positive for antibodies to BCV and to BRSV, respectively. Conventional herds had a significantly higher mean antibody prevalence to BCV and BRSV than the organically managed herds ( P <\u00a00.01). Animal age was significantly associated with increased antibody prevalence ( P <\u00a00.001). The findings of this study suggest that organic farm management may be effective in reducing the seroprevalence of these viruses relative to conventional farming methods."

        "abstract": "Supplemental Digital Content is Available in the Text. This study was designed to determine whether vonapanitase (formerly PRT-201), a recombinant human elastase, treatment can fragment the protein elastin in elastic fibers and cause dilation of atherosclerotic human peripheral arteries subjected to ex vivo balloon angioplasty. Seven patients undergoing lower limb amputation for peripheral artery disease or who died and donated their bodies to science donated 11 tibial arteries (5 anterior, 6 posterior) for this study. All arteries were atherosclerotic by visual inspection. The arteries underwent ex vivo balloon angioplasty and thereafter were cut into rings and studied on wire myographs where the rings were stretched and tension was recorded. After treatment with vonapanitase 2 mg/mL or vehicle control, myography was repeated and the rings were then subject to elastin content measurement using a desmosine radioimmunoassay and elastic fiber visualization by histology. The wire myography data were used to derive compliance, stress-strain, and incremental elastic modulus curves. Vonapanitase treatment reduced elastin (desmosine) content by 60% and decreased elastic fiber histologic staining. Vonapanitase-treated rings experienced less tension at any level of stretch and as a result had shifts in the compliance and stress-strain curves relative to vehicle-treated rings. Vonapanitase treatment did not alter the incremental elastic modulus curve. Vonapanitase treatment of atherosclerotic human peripheral arteries after ex vivo balloon angioplasty fragmented elastin in elastic fibers, decreased tension in the rings at any level of stretch, and altered the compliance and stress-strain curves in a manner predicting arterial dilation in vivo. Based on this result, local treatment of balloon angioplasty sites may increase blood vessel diameter and thereby improve the success of balloon angioplasty in peripheral artery disease."

        "abstract": "The sacroiliac joints connect the base of the sacrum to the ilium. When inflamed, they are suspected to cause low back pain. Inflammation of the sacroiliac joints is called sacroiliitis. The severity of the pain varies and depends on the degree of inflammation. Sacroiliitis is a hallmark of seronegative spondyloarthropathies. The presence or absence of chronic sacroiliitis is an important clue in the diagnosis of low back pain. This article aims to provide a concise overview of the anatomy, physiology, and molecular biology of sacroiliitis to aid clinicians in the assessment and management of sacroiliitis. For this narrative review, we evaluated articles in English published before August 2019 in PubMed. Then, we selected articles related to the painful manifestations of the sacroiliac joint. From the retrieved articles, we found that chronic sacroiliitis may be caused by various forms of spondyloarthritis, such as ankylosing spondyloarthritis. Sacroiliitis can also be associated with inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn\u2019s disease, gout, tuberculosis, brucellosis, and osteoarthritis, indicating common underlying etiological factors. The pathophysiology of sacroiliitis is complex and may involve internal, environmental, immunological, and genetic factors. Finally, genetic factors may also play a central role in progression of the disease. Knowing the genetic pre-disposition for sacroiliitis can be useful for diagnosis and for formulating treatment regimens, and may lead to a substantial reduction in disease severity and duration and to improved patient performance."

        "abstract": "A common process associated with oxidative stress and severe mitochondrial impairment is the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, as described in many neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening represents a potential target for inhibiting mitochondrial-driven cell death. Among the mitochondrial permeability transition pore components, cyclophilin D is the most studied and has been found increased under pathological conditions. Here, we have used in vitro and in vivo models of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy to investigate the relationship between the mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening and redox homeostasis. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a neurodegenerative condition caused by loss of function of the peroxisomal ABCD1 transporter, in which oxidative stress plays a pivotal role. In this study, we provide evidence of impaired mitochondrial metabolism in a peroxisomal disease, as fibroblasts in patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy cannot survive when forced to rely on mitochondrial energy production, i.e. on incubation in galactose. Oxidative stress induced under galactose conditions leads to mitochondrial damage in the form of mitochondrial inner membrane potential dissipation, ATP drop and necrotic cell death, together with increased levels of oxidative modifications in cyclophilin D protein. Moreover, we show increased expression levels of cyclophilin D in the affected zones of brains in patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy, in spinal cord of a mouse model of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( Abcd1 -null mice) and in fibroblasts from patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Notably, treatment with antioxidants rescues mitochondrial damage markers in fibroblasts from patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, including cyclophilin D oxidative modifications, and reverses cyclophilin D induction in vitro and in vivo . These findings provide mechanistic insight into the beneficial effects of antioxidants in neurodegenerative and non-neurodegenerative cyclophilin D-dependent disorders."

This anosmia and the frequency with which patients present is highly unusual. Coronaviruses have been known to cause common cold symptoms. COVID-19 infections have been described as causing more severe respiratory infections and the symptoms reported by authors from Wuhan, China have not specifically included anosmia. We describe patients who have presented during a two-week period of the COVID-19 pandemic with complete loss of sense of smell. Most had either no symptoms or mild respiratory symptoms. Many had a normal otolaryngologic exam. A relationship between COVID-19 and anosmia should be considered during the pandemic.

It is highly prevalent worldwide with a prevalence of 10-20% in the western world. The health-related quality of life (HRQL) is lower in individuals with GERD than in the general population and is comparable to that in individuals with other chronic diseases. It has a considerable impact on the quality of the patient\u2019s life through its symptoms and economically by following consultation procedures and medical care. A few studies have been done in Saudi Arabia using general population as subject and have reported a very high prevalence. (1) Estimation of gastro GERD prevalence among school teachers in Qassim region. (2) To assess the impact of GERD symptoms on teacher\u2019s daily life activity. (3) To compare prevalence and risk factors of GERD between age-groups and gender. A cross-sectional study that was conducted among 200 school teachers selected by multi-stage stratified random sample method in Qassim region during 2015. A reliable and valid self-administered GERD questionnaire for diagnosis of GERD was used. GERD-HRQL questionnaire was used to assess the impact of GERD on the patient\u2019s life quality. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 20.0; Chi-square was used to test the association between GERD and sociodemographic data. The total number of the participants was 200 with an equal male to female ratio. 55% (116/200) of the participants reported with GERD. 53 point 5% of these (62/116) were female and 46.6% (54/116) were male. The commonest age group was 31-40 years with 45.5% (91/200) participants. 13/200 (6.5%) participants were smokers, of which only 15.9% were female. 41 point 3% (48/116) of the GERD +ve participants were having blood group O +ve 7.8% (9/116) of GERD participants reported symptoms which affected their daily life activity. This study revealed a prevalence of GERD symptoms among 58% of school teachers. 7 point 8% of GERD participants reported symptoms which affected their daily life activities. These data indicate a need for a comprehensive approach to managing the GERD and related diseases and a more intensified level of awareness about GERD symptoms and its complications. In addition, a health care and preventive measure may be implemented to tackle the problem among school teachers."

Previous reports of viral coinfections with Aspergillus , including influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis, suggest that coronavirus disease 2019\u2013associated aspergillosis is plausible. This report aims to summarize what is known about coronavirus disease 2019 complicated by Aspergillus , introduces coronavirus disease 2019\u2013associated pulmonary aspergillosis as a possible clinical entity, and describes reasons clinical suspicion of Aspergillus is warranted in the critical care setting. We summarize the available evidence suggesting the existence of Aspergillus coinfection among severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients. This includes published coronavirus disease 2019 patient case series, a case description, and a review of potential biologic mechanisms. Reports of coronavirus disease 2019 patient attributes were selected if they included clinical, microbiologic, or radiologic signs of invasive fungal infection. Data included in summary tables were identified through a literature search for coronavirus disease 2019\u2013associated pulmonary aspergillosis. We present descriptive data extracted from coronavirus disease 2019\u2013associated pulmonary aspergillosis case series current at the time of article submission. Pulmonary aspergillosis is known to occur among influenza patients requiring intensive care and is associated with increased mortality. If Aspergillus coinfections are occurring among coronavirus disease 2019 patients, early clinical suspicion and testing are needed to understand the epidemiology of these infections and prevent associated mortality. As the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic unfolds, reports on the existence of this coinfection are needed, and opportunities to contribute cases of Aspergillus coinfection among coronavirus disease 2019 patients to an ongoing registry are described."

        "abstract": "Editor\u2019s Highlight: Hydroxyurea, a commonly used antineoplastic agent, induces teratogenesis accompanied by oxidative stress in rodent models. Banh and Hales report on the early and transient activation of p38 MAPK downstream of MEK3/6 following in utero exposure of murine embryos to hydroxyurea at gestational day 9. Hydroxyurea had a primary impact on neurological structures, where nuclear translocation of phospho-p38 and formation of \u03b3H2AX foci, accompanied by an increase in pyknotic nuclei, were observed in the malformation-sensitive caudal neuroepithelium. In contrast, the heart appeared protected despite the accumulation of \u03b3H2AX foci, the nuclear expression of phospho-p38 MAPK and the development of pyknotic nuclei were minimal in cardiac regions, suggesting that hydroxyurea may induce tissue-specific DNA repair mechanisms, such as nucleotide excision or crosslink repair. \u2014 Matthew Campen Hydroxyurea (HU) is commonly used to treat myeloproliferative diseases and sickle cell anemia. The administration of HU to gestation day 9 CD1 mice causes predominantly hindlimb, tail, and neural tube defects. HU induces oxidative stress and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in embryos. HU also inactivates ribonucleotide reductase, leading to DNA replication stress and DNA damage response signaling. We hypothesize that HU exposure induces p38 MAPK activation and DNA damage response signaling during organogenesis preferentially in malformation-sensitive tissues. HU treatment (400 or 600mg/kg) induced the activation of MEK3/6, upstream MAP2K3 kinases, within 30min; phospho-MEK3/6 immunoreactivity was increased throughout the embryo. Activation of the downstream p38 MAPK peaked 3h post-HU treatment. At this time, phospho-p38 MAPK immunoreactivity was enhanced in the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells in the rostral and caudal neuroepithelium and neural tube; significant increases in p38 MAPK signaling were not observed in the somites or heart. Interestingly, the DNA damage response, as assessed by the formation of \u03b3H2AX foci, was increased at 3h in HU-exposed embryos in all tissues examined, including the somites and heart. Increases in pyknotic nuclei and cell fragmentation were observed in all tissues except the heart, an organ that is relatively resistant to HU-induced malformations. Thus, although HU induces a widespread DNA damage response, the activation of p38 MAPK is localized to the rostral and caudal neuroepithelium and neural tube, suggesting that p38 MAPK pathways may play a role in mediating the specific malformations observed after HU exposure."

DNA was collected from peripheral blood samples before surgery, and the iMLDRTM multiple single-nucleotide polymorphism typing kit was used to detect 16 related single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites of interleukin-1A (IL-1A), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-1RN (IL-1RN), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), nuclear factor kappa-B1 (NF\u03baB1), REL (REL proto-oncogene, NF-kB subunit), and nuclear factor kappa-B inhibitor alpha (NF\u03baBIA).

Pharmacological perturbation of LAC3 causes dispersed localization of CASP1 and compensatory ectopic lignification. These results support the existence of a LAC3-based CS wall domain which coordinates with CSD M to provide bidirectional positional information that guides precise CS lignification."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the magnitude, associated risk factors of abortion, and its association with brucellosis in cattle of Jimma zone, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was carried out from October 2018 to October 2019 in Jimma zone. A total of 484 pregnant cattle were randomly selected from two districts based on the composition of the cattle population. Besides, blood samples were collected from a total of 484 randomly selected cattle to assess the presence of Brucella antibody. The presence of an antibody against Brucella organism was first tested by the Rose Bengal Plate test, and then positive serum was confirmed using the complement fixation test. An overall 14.30% cumulative incidence rate of abortion was recorded in study areas. In this study, breed, herd size, method of breeding, previous history of abortion, accessibility of dog to cattle and season were identified as risk factors for the occurrence of cattle abortion. Higher cumulative incidence of abortion (31.82%) was observed in Brucella antibody positive cattle than those of antibody negative cattle (13.42%). However, the difference noted was not statistically significant ( P <0.05). It is important to create awareness about the impact of the abortion on cattle production and the applicable control technique of abortion should be aimed and implemented. Moreover, further investigation should be conducted to identify the specific cause of abortion and the associated loss in the study areas."

        "abstract": "The protection level offered by filtering facepiece particulate respirators and face masks is defined by the percentage of ambient particles penetrating inside the protection device. There are two penetration pathways: (1) through the faceseal leakage, and the (2) filter medium. This study aimed at differentiating the contributions of these two pathways for particles in the size range of 0.03\u20131 \u03bcm under actual breathing conditions. One N95 filtering facepiece respirator and one surgical mask commonly used in health care environments were tested on 25 subjects (matching the latest National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health fit testing panel) as the subjects performed conventional fit test exercises. The respirator and the mask were also tested with breathing manikins that precisely mimicked the prerecorded breathing patterns of the tested subjects. The penetration data obtained in the human subject- and manikin-based tests were compared for different particle sizes and breathing patterns. Overall, 5250 particle size- and exercise-specific penetration values were determined. For each value, the faceseal leakage-to-filter ratio was calculated to quantify the relative contributions of the two penetration pathways. The number of particles penetrating through the faceseal leakage of the tested respirator/mask far exceeded the number of those penetrating through the filter medium. For the N95 respirator, the excess was (on average) by an order of magnitude and significantly increased with an increase in particle size (p < 0.001): \u223c7-fold greater for 0.04 \u03bcm, \u223c10-fold for 0.1 \u03bcm, and \u223c20-fold for 1 \u03bcm. For the surgical mask, the faceseal leakage-to-filter ratio ranged from 4.8 to 5.8 and was not significantly affected by the particle size for the tested submicrometer fraction. Facial/body movement had a pronounced effect on the relative contribution of the two penetration pathways. Breathing intensity and facial dimensions showed some (although limited) influence. Because most of the penetrated particles entered through the faceseal, the priority in respirator/mask development should be shifted from improving the efficiency of the filter medium to establishing a better fit that would eliminate or minimize faceseal leakage."

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine its prognostic potential for gastrointestinal cancers. A literature survey was conducted by searching the PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase together with Wanfang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database for articles published as of October 15, 2017. Hazard ratio (HR) or odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated to demonstrate prognostic value of PCAT-1 using Stata 12.0 software. A total of 6 studies with 961 cases were pooled in the analysis to evaluate the prognostic value of PCAT-1 in gastrointestinal cancers. Increased PCAT-1 expression was significantly correlated with poor overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.02\u20131.06). Statistical significance was also observed in subgroup meta-analysis stratified by cancer type, histology type, sample size, and analysis type. Additionally, high expression of PCAT-1 was significantly associated with deeper tumor invasion (OR = 4.46, 95% CI: 3.00\u20136.63), positive lymph node metastasis (OR = 3.76, 95% CI: 1.39\u201310.16), and advanced clinical stage (OR\u200a=\u200a4.09, 95% CI: 1.55\u201310.82). High expression of PCAT-1 was related to poor prognosis and could be a promising biomarker of clinicopathologic features in gastrointestinal cancers. More studies will be necessary to verify and strengthen the clinical value of PCAT-1 in gastrointestinal cancers."

        "abstract": "Joint registries classify all further arthroplasty procedures to a knee with an existing partial arthroplasty as revision surgery, regardless of the actual procedure performed. Relatively minor procedures, including bearing exchanges, are classified in the same way as major operations requiring augments and stems. A new classification system is proposed to acknowledge and describe the detail of these procedures, which has implications for risk, recovery, and health economics. Classification categories were proposed by a surgical consensus group, then ranked by patients, according to perceived invasiveness and implications for recovery. In round one, 26 revision cases were classified by the consensus group. Results were tested for inter-rater reliability. In round two, four additional cases were added for clarity. Round three repeated the survey one month later, subject to inter- and intrarater reliability testing. In round four, five additional expert partial knee arthroplasty surgeons were asked to classify the 30 cases according to the proposed revision partial knee classification (RPKC) system. Four classes were proposed: PR1, where no bone-implant interfaces are affected; PR2, where surgery does not include conversion to total knee arthroplasty, for example, a second partial arthroplasty to a native compartment; PR3, when a standard primary total knee prosthesis is used; and PR4 when revision components are necessary. Round one resulted in 92% inter-rater agreement (Kendall\u2019s W 0.97; p < 0.005), rising to 93% in round two (Kendall\u2019s W 0.98; p < 0.001). Round three demonstrated 97% agreement (Kendall\u2019s W 0.98; p < 0.001), with high intra-rater reliability (interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.99; 95% confidence interval 0.98 to 0.99). Round four resulted in 80% agreement (Kendall\u2019s W 0.92; p < 0.001). The RPKC system accounts for all procedures which may be appropriate following partial knee arthroplasty. It has been shown to be reliable, repeatable and pragmatic. The implications for patient care and health economics are discussed. Cite this article: Bone Jt Open 2021;2(8):638\u2013645."

The study mainly validates the impact of GCP on manufacturing for diminishing the emerged pollution to the environment. The study develops Neutrosophic Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making Framework (N-MCDMF) according to neutrosophic theory and various MCDM methods of grey relational analysis (GRA), analytic network process (ANP), the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory technique (DEMATEL), and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to support the decision-makers with highly systematic procedures in the uncertain and inconsistent environmental conditions. The N-MCDMF evaluates the conditions of GCP and recommends the optimal Supply Chain Management (SCM) in manufacturing alternatives. A case study is presented for the validation of the issues of applicability and flexibility for the proposed N-MCDMF. The results obtained from the implementation of the N-MCDMF indicates the applicability and flexibility of the proposed approach. In addition, results show that SCM in manufacturing can provide more cooperation for the environment to reduce harmful pollution and to attain sustainability for achieving motivations under the restrictions of GCP."

Their nature is controversial with arguments for and against a neoplastic origin. Neoplastic proliferations are by definition monoclonal, whereas reactive processes originate from a polyclonal background. We examined clonality of 25 samples of desmoid tissue from 11 female FAP patients by assessing patterns of X-chromosome inactivation to calculate a clonality ratio. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a polymorphic CAG short tandem repeat (STR) sequence adjacent to a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme site within the human androgen receptor (HUMARA) gene using fluorescent-labelled primers enabled analysis of PCR products by Applied Biosystems Genescan II TM software. Twenty-one samples from nine patients were informative for the assay. Samples from all informative cases comprised a median of 66% (range 0\u201375%) clonal cells but from the six patients with a clonality ratio \u22640.5 comprised a median of 71% (65\u201375%) clonal cells. FAP-associated desmoid tumours are true neoplasms. This may have implications in the development of improved treatment protocols for patients with these aggressive tumours. \u00a9 2000 Cancer Research Campaign"

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression among Arab breast cancer patients and assess the quality of life with reference to socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. This cross-sectional study was conducted among female breast cancer patients diagnosed between January 2009 and March 2014, who were recruited from the outpatient clinics of Naef K. Basile Cancer Institute at the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC) from November 2015 till December 2016. An interview was conducted utilizing two validated questionnaires: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B). Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics that might predict patient quality of life were collected and summarized. A total of 150 patients were interviewed (median age 53.5\u00b110.4 years). Most were assessed 3 to 5 years (68.7%) after initial diagnosis and had undergone surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or hormonal therapy (97.3%, 79.3%, 80.7% and 86.0%, respectively). The median total HADS score was 10.0 \u00b1 8.0, with approximately 41.3% of study participants having abnormal scores on the anxiety subscale and 24.7% on the depression subscale. Significant predictors of total HADS score were nationality and level of education (p=0.001, p=0.001 respectively; R 2 =0.181). Participants who were Iraqi, had stage IV disease, had a household monthly income below 1000 USD, or had received chemotherapy exhibited significantly lower total FACT-B scores, these being highly negatively correlated with total HADS scores (r s = -0.73, p=0.001). There is a vital need for the development of individualized interventions and psychosocial support programs tailored to the physical and psychological well-being of breast cancer patients in the Levant region."

A genetic deficiency in the enzymatic activity of one of these hydrolases will lead to the accumulation of the material meant for lysosomal degradation. Examples include glycogen in the case of Pompe disease, glycosaminoglycans in the case of the mucopolysaccharidoses, glycoproteins in the cases of the oligosaccharidoses, and sphingolipids in the cases of Niemann-Pick disease types A and B, Gaucher disease, Tay-Sachs disease, Krabbe disease, and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Sometimes, the lysosomal storage can be caused not by the enzymatic deficiency of one of the hydrolases, but by the deficiency of an activator protein, as occurs in the AB variant of GM2 gangliosidosis. Still other times, the accumulated lysosomal material results from failed egress of a small molecule as a consequence of a deficient transporter, as in cystinosis or Salla disease. In the last couple of decades, enzyme replacement therapy has become available for a number of lysosomal storage diseases. Examples include imiglucerase, taliglucerase and velaglucerase for Gaucher disease, laronidase for Hurler disease, idursulfase for Hunter disease, elosulfase for Morquio disease, galsulfase for Maroteaux-Lamy disease, alglucosidase alfa for Pompe disease, and agalsidase alfa and beta for Fabry disease. In addition, substrate reduction therapy has been approved for certain disorders, such as eliglustat for Gaucher disease. The advent of treatment options for some of these disorders has led to newborn screening pilot studies, and ultimately to the addition of Pompe disease and Hurler disease to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) in 2015 and 2016, respectively."

Methods: Randomized assessor-blinded controlled trial with 2 arms; one arm received acupuncture twice weekly for 8 weeks, while the other arm was a wait-list control group receiving only standard care. Primary outcome was pain intensity and interference over the past week using the Brief Pain Inventory at the end of the intervention. Secondary outcomes included clinical assessment (CTCAE [Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events] grading and Total Neuropathy Score\u2013Clinical Version) and nerve conduction studies; and patient-reported outcome measures (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy\u2013Gynecologic Oncology Group\u2013Neurotoxicity Quality of Life scale and Symptom Distress Scale) assessed at baseline, end of treatment (8 weeks), week 14, and week 20 from the beginning of treatment. Results: Eighty-seven patients were randomized to the experimental arm (n = 44) and to the standard care wait-list control arm (n = 43). Significant changes at 8 weeks were detected in relation to primary outcome (pain), the clinical neurological assessment, quality of life domains, and symptom distress (all P < .05). Improvements in pain interference, neurotoxicity-related symptoms, and functional aspects of quality of life were sustained in the 14-week assessment ( P < .05), as were physical and functional well-being at the 20-week assessment ( P < .05). Conclusions: Acupuncture is an effective intervention for treating chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and improving patients\u2019 quality of life and experience with neurotoxicity-related symptoms with longer term effects evident."

The aim of our study was to develop a serum miRNA\u2010based molecular signature for the early detection and prognosis prediction of NSCLC. The significantly altered circulating miRNAs were profiled in GSE24709. The top ten upregulated miRNAs were miR\u2010432, miR\u2010942, miR\u201029c\u20105p, miR\u2010601, miR\u2010613, miR\u2010520d\u20103p, miR\u20101261, miR\u2010132\u20105p, miR\u2010302b, and miR\u2010154\u20105p, while the top ten downregulated miRNAs were miR\u2010562, miR\u201018b, miR\u20109\u20103p, miR\u2010154\u20103p, miR\u201020b, miR\u201018a, miR\u2010487a, miR\u201020a, miR\u2010103, and miR\u2010144. Then, the top four upregulated serum miRNAs (miR\u2010432, miR\u2010942, miR\u201029c\u20105p, and miR\u2010601) were validated by real\u2010time quantitative PCR. The clinical significance of two candidate serum miRNAs, miR\u2010942 and miR\u2010601, was further explored. Our results showed that the expression levels of serum miR\u2010942 and serum miR\u2010601 were significantly upregulated in NSCLC. In addition, serum miR\u2010942 and serum miR\u2010601 showed better performance than CEA, CYFRA21\u20101, and SCCA for early diagnosis of NSCLC. Combining serum miR\u2010942 and serum miR\u2010601 enhanced the efficacy of detecting early\u2010stage NSCLC. Moreover, high serum miR\u2010942 and serum miR\u2010601 were both associated with adverse clinical variables and poor survival. The NSCLC patients with simultaneously high serum miR\u2010942 and serum miR\u2010601 suffered worst clinical outcome, while those with simultaneously low serum miR\u2010942 and serum miR\u2010601 had most favorable outcome. The multivariate analysis showed that serum miR\u2010942 and serum miR\u2010601 were independent prognostic factors for NSCLC. Taken together, serum miR\u2010942 and serum miR\u2010601 might serve as a promising molecular signature for the early detection and prognosis prediction of NSCLC. Serum miR\u2010942 and serum miR\u2010601 have combinatory effects for the prognosis prediction of NSLCC. "

In the last quarter-century since its publication, several studies have reported that the microbiological spectrum of endophthalmitis is not the same across the world; there is emerging antibiotic resistance of gram-negative microorganisms to the EVS recommended antibiotics; there are newer molecules that could cross the blood-retinal barrier; the advances in vitreous surgery have become safer than before, and there are newer methods of microbiological evaluation. One of the often-mentioned drawbacks of the EVS was not recruiting grossly infected eyes with poor visibility of the iris and vitreous. Keeping these factors in mind, a new prospective multi-centered randomized study, the Endophthalmitis Management Study (EMS), is designed. The EMS will recruit all post-cataract surgery endophthalmitis patients irrespective of severity (including suspected fungal infection); the EMS will use quantifiable inflammatory score instead of the presenting vision to allocate for surgery, randomize the eyes to two different combinations of intravitreal antibiotics and use the newer microbiological diagnostic techniques. We believe the EMS findings will complement the EVS recommendations."

        "abstract": "Antipsychotic drugs have been implicated as risk factors for QT prolongation, which is a predictor of sudden cardiac death. However, the QT interval is considered an imperfect marker for proarrhythmic risk. Recently, improved methods, namely, QT dispersion (QTD), QTD ratio (QTDR), T wave peak-to-end interval (Tp-e), Tp-e/QT ratio and Tp-e/QTc ratio, have been regarded as proarrhythmic risk markers. We attempted to reevaluate the risk of sudden cardiac death due to antipsychotics use by measuring these improved evaluation methods. We retrospectively evaluated QTc, QTD, QTDR, Tp-e, Tp-e/QT ratio and Tp-e/QTc ratio from the medical records of 410 patients with schizophrenia diagnosed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision, or 5th Edition. Information on drugs administered was obtained from medical records. We investigated the correlation between each index on ECG and medication, such as antipsychotics, prescribed to participants with linear regression analysis. We also compared each index between 235 healthy controls and 235 patients matched for age and sex. Positive correlations between QTc and levomepromazine and brexpiprazole were identified. Levomepromazine and lithium were positively correlated with QTD. Levomepromazine, quetiapine, asenapine, clozapine and carbamazepine were positively correlated with QTDR. Levomepromazine, olanzapine, brexpiprazole and lithium were positively correlated with Tp-e. Olanzapine, brexpiprazole and lithium were positively correlated with the Tp-e/QT ratio. Olanzapine, brexpiprazole and lithium were positively correlated with Tp-e/QTc ratio. Significant differences in all indexes were noted between the patients and healthy controls. According to our results, the prediction of the risk of sudden cardiac death by each index was inconsistent. We should evaluate the predictive factor of ventricular arrhythmia according to various electrocardiogram indexes because QTc alone could not identify the risk of sudden cardiac death."

        "abstract": "Selenoneine is the major selenium compound in fish muscles, and fish appears to be an important source of selenium in the fish-eating population. Selenoneine has strong antioxidant activity and a detoxifying function against methylmercury (MeHg) toxicity. Dietary intake, bioaccumulation, and metabolism of selenoneine have not been characterized in humans. A nutritional survey was conducted in remote islands of the Kagoshima Prefecture in Japan. To evaluate the potential risks and benefits of fish consumption for health, we measured concentrations of selenoneine, total selenium, MeHg, inorganic mercury, and polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) in the blood of a fish-eating human population. The erythrocyte, leukocyte, and platelet residues following removal of serum (cellular fraction) contained 0.510\u00a0\u03bcg Se/g, 0.212\u00a0\u03bcg selenoneine Se/g, and 0.262\u00a0\u03bcg Se-containing proteins Se/g, whereas the serum contained 0.174\u00a0\u03bcg total Se/g. Selenoneine was highly concentrated in the cellular fraction in a manner that was dependent on subjects' frequency of fish consumption. Concentrations of selenoneine were closely correlated with concentrations of MeHg in the cellular fraction. Selenoneine is the major chemical form of selenium in the blood cells of this fish-eating human population and may be an important biomarker for selenium redox status."

The left IPA activated the earliest, and was followed by the activation of the left STA, the right IPA and the right STA. We elucidated active cortical areas and their time courses during simple calculation by using whole-scalp magnetoencephalography. Twelve healthy volunteers were asked to view meaningless figures ( figure viewing ) or digits ( digit viewing ) and add single digits ( calculation ). The magnetic signals of the brain were measured using a helmet-shaped 122-channel neuromagnetometer during the three tasks. The occipital, inferior posterior temporal, and middle temporal areas of each hemisphere and the left superior temporal area (STA) were activated during all tasks (approximately 250\u00a0ms after the stimulus onset). The calculation-related sources were located in the left inferior parietal area (IPA) in 8 subjects, right IPA in 5, left STA in 3, right STA in 5, right inferior frontal area in 2, and left inferior frontal area in 1. The IPA and STA of the left hemisphere were activated more strongly and significantly earlier than those of the right hemisphere: the left IPA was activated first (mean activation timing: 301\u00a0ms), followed by activations of the left STA (369\u00a0ms), right IPA (419\u00a0ms), and right STA (483\u00a0ms). Simple digit addition is executed mainly in the left IPA and left STA, followed by the recognition processes of results in the right IPA and right STA. This study clarified the cortical process during simple calculation, with excellent temporal and spatial resolution; the IPA and STA of the left hemisphere were activated more strongly and earlier than the corresponding areas of the right hemisphere."

INMECs were obtained from healthy rats, and divided into five groups: Control, platelets, platelets +2.5 \u00b5M curcumin, platelets +5.0 \u00b5M curcumin and platelets +10.0 \u00b5M curcumin. Curcumin toxicity was determined and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations of the five groups were measured using ELISA. The branch point numbers were measured using a capillary tube formation experiment, invasion cell numbers were evaluated with the Transwell assay, relative protein expression levels were measured with western blot assay and immunofluorescence staining of the nucleus. The 2.5, 5 and 10 \u00b5M curcumin concentrations were found to be suitable for INMECs. Curcumin significantly downregulated VEGF concentration, suppressed vascular lumen formation and inhibited invasion cell numbers in a dose-dependent manner. The \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, collagen I, E-cadherin, phosphorylated (p-) phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p-protein kinase B (AKT), p-mammalian target of rapamycin (m-TOR) and hypoxia inducible factor subunit alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) protein expression levels of the curcumin-treated groups were significantly downregulated in a dose-dependent manner compared with the platelet group. HIF-1\u03b1 protein expression levels in the nucleus of the curcumin-treated groups were significantly suppressed in a dose-dependent manner compared with the platelet group. In conclusion, curcumin suppressed INMEC invasion and angiogenesis induced by activated platelets via inhibiting the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway."

This review discusses the properties of a new drug, eluxadoline, a gut-targeting mu- and kappa-opioid receptor agonist and a delta-opioid receptor antagonist, and its efficacy and safety in patients with IBS-D. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to identify studies that had investigated eluxadoline as a treatment in IBS-D. A narrative review of other information is provided with respect to pharmacological and chemical properties. Where suitable, meta-analysis was performed with a random-effects model to produce a pooled estimate. Eluxadoline showed efficacy improving stool consistency (standardized mean difference [SMD]: \u22120.29 at 12 weeks, p = 0.0004; \u22120.46 at 26 weeks, p = 0.0001), global symptoms (SMD: \u22120.15 at 12 weeks, p = 0.006; \u22120.14 at 26 weeks, p = 0.02), quality of life (SMD: 0.21 at 12 weeks, p < 0.0001; 0.16 at 26 weeks, p = 0.007), pain (SMD: \u22120.17 at 12 weeks, p = 0.001; \u22120.16 at 26 weeks, p = 0.01), and adequate relief (odds ratio [OR]: 1.99 at 12 weeks, p < 0.00001; 1.78 at 26 weeks, p < 0.0001). It also improved IBS severity and other abdominal symptoms such as bloating, discomfort, and risk of urgency and fecal incontinence. Its main side effects included constipation (OR: 3.49, p < 0.00001), vomiting (OR: 3.42, p = 0.0002), abdominal pain (OR: 1.78, p = 0.007), and nausea (OR: 1.42, p = 0.07). The overall quality of trials was satisfactory with the meta-analyses providing largely homogeneous outcomes. Eluxadoline\u2019s place in clinical practice might prove useful since the pharmacological options of IBS-D are limited and eluxadoline showed a positive effect in treating the symptoms of IBS-D."

Identification of new protective antigens is a key imperative for the development of more effective novel vaccine. The objective of this study was to evaluate antibody responses of 27 recombinant proteins in convalescent sera obtained from pigs that were naturally infected with M.\u00a0hyopneumoniae . Fifteen proteins were identified as serological immunodominant antigens, while 3 proteins were not recognized by any convalescent serum. Moreover, Mhp462, a leucine aminopeptidase, was found to be a discriminative serological immunodominant antigen which reacted with convalescent sera but not with hyperimmune sera. The serological immunodominant proteins were antigenic and were expressed during infection; this suggests that these proteins (especially the discriminative one) are potential candidate antigens for the development of next generation vaccines against M.\u00a0hyopneumoniae .

This study aimed at evaluating the occurrence of Trypanosoma cruzi vectors based on the main species captured in Southern Rio Grande do Sul State from 2008 to 2019. The study area comprised counties that belong to the 3 rd Regional Health Coordination (RHC) and to the 7 th RHC, whose headquarters are in Pelotas and Bage, respectively. The study was based on secondary data provided by the partnership between the Federal University of Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul State (UFPel-RS) and the State Health Surveillance Center in RS (SCHS-RS). One thousand and four hundred triatomines were captured in the area supervised by the 3 rd RHC, mainly in Cangucu (37.7%), Piratini (22.4%) and Pinheiro Machado (15.1%), while, in the area supervised by the 7 th RHC, the largest number of triatomines was captured in Lavras do Sul (64.15%). In both areas, Triatoma rubrovaria (90.6%) and Panstrongylus tupynambai (7.4%) were the most common species. Most were captured inside households but T. cruzi -positive insects were not found in the period under study. The results of this study show that, in Southern Rio Grande do Sul State, there is still a high rate of triatomine household invasion and dispersal, mainly by T. rubrovaria . Thus, the entomological surveillance should be maintained with the participation of the population and further studies should be deepened in the area."

DNA was extracted from the maternal plasma of alloimmunized and non-alloimmunized women between 7 and 34 wk of gestation. RHD sequence was determined by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results were compared with RhD phenotype obtained from cord blood samples of neonates. A total of 135 samples from RhD-negative pregnant women were collected. The foetal RHD status was conclusive in all 135 (100%) cases. The highest number of cases reported for RHD genotyping were from Punjab (38.5%) followed by Haryana (24.4%), Himachal Pradesh (17.0%) and Chandigarh Union Territory (13.3%). The non-invasive test correctly predicted the foetal RhD phenotype in 133 of 135 cases, making the accuracy of the test as 98.51 per cent [95% confidence interval (CI): 97.90-99.50%]. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the test were 99.18 per cent (95% CI: 95.52-99.98%) and 92.31 per cent (95% CI: 63.97-99.81%), respectively, with negative and positive predictive values of 99.80 per cent (95% CI: 94.85-99.87%) and 96.31 per cent (95% CI: 62.87-98.84%), respectively. Non-invasive foetal RHD determination by single-exon quantitative PCR exhibited high accuracy and could be used in routine clinical practice after confirmatory studies are done."

Non-ischemic myocardial injury secondary to cytokine storm is thought to be the predominant mechanism of acute cardiac injury associated with COVID-19. Multiple mechanisms and processes contribute to cardiac injury resulting in a poor outcome. Some of these are not clearly understood. Clinical and diagnostic details of cardiovascular involvement in these patients are mostly limited to biochemical markers. Multiple therapeutic agents have been tried with questionable efficacy and without clinical evidence. Interactions of comorbidities, cardiovascular drugs, the cardiac effect of therapeutic agents on the illness continue to be under investigation.

Four types of corn grains were obtained from different origins (Brazil, Ukraine, Russia, and Iran). Eighty-day-old Ross 308 male broiler chicks were fed a standard diet until day 18, and experimental diets were fed from 19 to 24\u00a0D of age. Five dietary treatments consisted of 4 semi-purified diets containing corn from each origin as the only source of amino acid ( AA ) and a N-free diet for determination of basal endogenous AA losses. Assay diets contained 939\u00a0g of test corn/kg. The concentration of crude protein and gross energy ranged from 7.58 to 8.39% (coefficient of variation [ CV ]\u00a0=\u00a04.72%) and 4,121 to 4,621\u00a0kcal/kg (CV\u00a0=\u00a05.09%), respectively. There was significant variation among the 4 corn grains in standardized ileal digestibility ( SID ) for CP, Phe, Leu, Asp, Glu, Ser, Gly, Ala, and Tyr ( P \u2264\u00a00.05). The results of linear regression showed that linear prediction equations based on protein content can be used to predict the TAA and SIDAA contents (e.g., TLys\u00a0=\u00a00.041\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0CP, adj R 2 = 95.9, standard error of prediction [ SEP ] = 0.05; SIDLys\u00a0=\u00a00.0356\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0CP, adj R 2 = 96, SEP\u00a0=\u00a00.051). Inclusion of other proximate components of test samples into the regression equation increased the R 2 value and decreased the SEP value (e.g., TLys\u00a0=\u00a00.329\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0crude fiber [ CF ] \u2012 0.209 \u00d7 Ash, adj R 2 = 99.9, SEP\u00a0=\u00a00.005; SIDLys\u00a0=\u00a0\u20121.1591\u00a0+\u00a00.836\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0CF \u2012 0.055 \u00d7 Ash, adj R 2 = 99.9, SEP\u00a0=\u00a00.001). The concentration of TAA and SIDAA was highly correlated (adj R 2 > 89%) for most AA and showed that the amount of SIDAA could be predicted from its total concentration with a high degree of accuracy (e.g., SIDLys\u00a0=\u00a00.0023\u00a0+\u00a00.861 \u00d7 TLys, adj R 2 = 99.9, SEP\u00a0=\u00a00.0001). In conclusion, this in\u00a0vitro assays and equations accurately predicted TAA and SIDAA corn grain samples for broiler chickens and can serve as a reference analysis to develop calibration equations for rapid feed quality evaluation methods such as near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy."

The intervention group will be given access to the intervention's website (www.traumatips.nl), and are specifically requested to login within the first month postinjury. The primary clinical study outcome is PTSD symptom severity. Secondary outcomes include symptoms of depression and anxiety, quality of life, and social support. In addition, a cost-effectiveness analysis of the intervention will be performed. Data are collected at one week post-injury, prior to first login (baseline), and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Analyses will be on an intention-to-treat basis. The results will provide more insight into the effects of preventive interventions in general, and Internet-based early interventions specifically, on acute stress reactions and PTSD, in an injured population, during the acute phase after trauma. We will discuss possible strengths and limitations."

        "abstract": "Cryo-soft X-ray tomography (cryo-SXT) is a powerful imaging technique that can extract ultrastructural information from whole, unstained mammalian cells as close to the living state as possible. Subcellular organelles including the nucleus, the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria have been identified by morphology alone, due to the similarity in contrast to transmission electron micrographs. In this study, we used cryo-SXT to image endosomes and autophagosomes, organelles that are particularly susceptible to chemical fixation artefacts during sample preparation for electron microscopy. We used two approaches to identify these compartments. For early and recycling endosomes, which are accessible to externally-loaded markers, we used an anti-transferrin receptor antibody conjugated to 10\u00a0nm gold particles. For autophagosomes, which are not accessible to externally-applied markers, we developed a correlative cryo-fluorescence and cryo-SXT workflow (cryo-CLXM) to localise GFP-LC3 and RFP-Atg9. We used a stand-alone cryo-fluorescence stage in the home laboratory to localise the cloned fluorophores, followed by cryo-soft X-ray tomography at the synchrotron to analyse cellular ultrastructure. We mapped the 3D ultrastructure of the endocytic and autophagic structures, and discovered clusters of omegasomes arising from \u2018hotspots\u2019 on the ER. Thus, immunogold markers and cryo-CLXM can be used to analyse cellular processes that are inaccessible using other imaging modalities. \u2022 We image whole, unstained mammalian cells using cryo-soft X-ray tomography. \u2022 Endosomes are identified using a gold marker for the transferrin receptor. \u2022 A new workflow for correlative cryo-fluorescence and cryo-SXT is used to locate early autophagosomes. \u2022 Interactions between endosomes, endoplasmic reticulum and forming autophagosomes are mapped in 3D. \u2022 Multiple omegasomes are shown to form at \u2018hotspots\u2019 on the endoplasmic reticulum.

Sleep has been linked with mortality among cancer-free population; however, its association with survival among women with breast cancer is understudied. Breast cancer patients ( N =3682) reported their average sleep duration post diagnosis. Subsamples also provided their pre-diagnosis sleep duration ( n =1949) and post-diagnosis sleep difficulties ( n =1353). Multivariate Cox models estimated hazard ratios (HR) and confidence intervals (CI) of all-cause, breast cancer, and non-breast cancer mortality. At diagnosis, the mean age was 64.9 years and 91.7% were stage I or II. Women sleeping \u2a7e9\u2009h per night post diagnosis had a strong higher risk of all-cause (multivariate HRs: MV-HR=1.37, CI=1.10\u20131.71), breast cancer (MV-HR=1.46, CI=1.02\u20132.07), and non-breast cancer mortality (MV-HR=1.34, CI=1.01\u20131.79), compared to women sleeping 8\u2009h per night. Increased sleep duration post diagnosis ( vs unchanged) and regular sleep difficulties ( vs rare/none) were associated with a strong elevated risk of all-cause mortality (MV-HR increased duration =1.35, CI=1.04\u20131.74; MV-HR regular difficulties =1.49, CI=1.02\u20132.19) and a moderate greater risk of breast cancer and non-breast cancer mortality. Various facets of sleep were associated with higher all-cause mortality risk. If replicated, these findings support evaluation of breast cancer patients' sleep duration and difficulties to identify those at risk for poorer outcomes."

        "abstract": "Liver injury occurs frequently during sepsis, which leads to high mortality and morbidity. A previous study has suggested that salvianolic acid B (SalB) is protective against sepsis-induced lung injury. However, whether SalB is able to protect against sepsis-induced liver injury remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of SalB on sepsis-induced liver injury and its potential underlying mechanisms. Sepsis was induced in mice using a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) method. The mice were treated with SalB (30 mg/kg intraperitoneally) at 0.5, 2 and 8 h after CLP induction. Pathological alterations of the liver were assessed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-6 were measured. The hepatic mRNA levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, Bax and Bcl-2 were also detected. The results suggested that treatment with SalB ameliorated sepsis-induced liver injury in the mice, as supported by the mitigated pathologic changes and lowered serum aminotransferase levels. SalB also decreased the levels of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the serum and the liver of the CLP model mice. In addition, SalB significantly downregulated Bax expression and upregulated Bcl-2 expression, and upregulated the expression levels of SIRT1 and PGC-1\u03b1. However, when sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) small interfering RNA was co-administered with SalB, the protective effects of SalB were attenuated and the expression levels of SIRT1 and PGC-1\u03b1 were reduced. In summary, these results indicate that SalB mitigates sepsis-induced liver injury via reduction of the inflammatory response and hepatic apoptosis, and the underlying mechanism may be associated with the activation of SIRT1/PGC-1\u03b1 signaling."

Similar to conditions seen in humans, canine atopic dermatitis (CAD) is characterized by derangement of corneocytes and disorganization of intercellular lipids in the stratum corenum (SC) with decreased ceramide levels. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a moisturizer containing ceramide on dogs with CAD. Dogs (n = 20, 3~8 years old) with mild to moderate clinical signs were recruited and applied a moisturizer containing ceramide for 4 weeks. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin hydration, pruritus index for canine atopic dermatitis (PICAD) scores, and canine atopic dermatitis extent and severity index (CADESI) scores of all dogs were evaluated. Skin samples from five dogs were also examined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using ruthenium tetroxide. TEWL, PICAD, and CADESI values decreased ( p < 0.05) and skin hydration increased dramatically over time ( p < 0.05). Electron micrographs showed that the skin barrier of all five dogs was partially restored ( p < 0.05). In conclusion, these results demonstrated that moisturizer containing ceramide was effective for treating skin barrier dysfunction and CAD symptoms."

Activation of sigma 1 receptor (Sig1R) has been shown to preserve cone function through 6 weeks in the rd10 mouse model of RP, when mice were treated systemically with the Sig1R ligand (+)-pentazocine (PTZ). This study determined the extent to which cone function is preserved in rd10 mice when Sig1R is activated. Rd10 mice were administered (+)-PTZ (alternate days beginning at postnatal day [P]14) over a period of 180 days. Mouse visual function and structure were measured in vivo using optokinetic tracking response, scotopic and photopic electroretinography plus photopic assessment using \u201cnatural\u201d noise stimuli, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Immunofluorescent methods were used to detect cones in retinal cryosections. Visual acuity was maintained in rd10 (+)-PTZ-treated mice through P56, whereas rd10 nontreated mice showed marked decline by P28. Cone responses were detected in (+)-PTZ-treated mice through P60, which were more robust when tested with natural noise stimuli; cone responses were minimal in nontreated rd10 mice. OCT revealed significantly thicker retinas in (+)-PTZ-treated rd10 mice through P60 compared to nontreated mice. Cones were detected by immunofluorescence in (+)-PTZ-treated rd10 retinas through P120. The extent to which cone rescue could be sustained in (+)-PTZ-treated rd10 mice was evaluated comprehensively, showing that activation of Sig1R is associated with prolonged visual acuity, extended detection of cone function, and detection of cones in retinal histologic sections. The data reflect promising long-term neuroprotection when Sig1R is activated."

This study aimed to estimate the number of lung cancer deaths attributable to indoor radon exposure, its burden of disease, and the effects of radon mitigation in Korea in 2010. Lung cancer deaths due to indoor radon exposure were estimated using exposure-response relations reported in previous studies. Years of life lost (YLLs) were calculated to quantify disease burden in relation to premature deaths. Mitigation effects were examined under scenarios in which all homes with indoor radon concentrations above a specified level were remediated below the level. The estimated number of lung cancer deaths attributable to indoor radon exposure ranged from 1946 to 3863, accounting for 12.5\u201324.7% of 15623 total lung cancer deaths in 2010. YLLs due to premature deaths were estimated at 43140\u2013101855 years (90\u2013212 years per 100000 population). If all homes with radon levels above 148 Bq/m 3 are effectively remediated, 502\u2013732 lung cancer deaths and 10972\u201318479 YLLs could be prevented. These findings suggest that indoor radon exposure contributes considerably to lung cancer, and that reducing indoor radon concentration would be helpful for decreasing the disease burden from lung cancer deaths."

        "abstract": "Zinc is an essential nutritional trace element for all forms of life as it plays an important role in numerous biological processes. In poultry, zinc is provided by in-feed supplementation, mainly as zinc oxide or zinc sulfate. Alternatively zinc can be supplemented as organic sources, which are characterized by using an organic ligand that may be an amino acid, peptide, or protein to bind zinc and have a higher bioavailability than inorganic zinc sources. There are limited number of studies directly comparing the effects of inorganic vs. organic zinc sources on performance and intestinal health in broilers. Therefore, a digestibility and a performance study were conducted to evaluate and compare the effect of an amino acid-complexed zinc source vs. an inorganic zinc source on intestinal health. The experiment consisted of 2 treatments: either a zinc amino acid complex or zinc sulfate was added to a wheat\u2013rye based diet at 60 ppm Zn, with 10 replicates (34 broilers per pen) per treatment. Effects on performance, intestinal morphology, microbiota composition, and oxidative stress were measured. Supplementing zinc amino acid complexes improved the zinc digestibility coefficient as compared to supplementation with zinc sulfate. Broilers supplemented with zinc amino acid complexes had a significantly lower feed conversion ratio in the starter phase compared to birds supplemented with zinc sulfate . A significantly higher villus length was observed in broilers supplemented with zinc amino acid complexes at days 10 and 28. Supplementation with zinc amino acid complexes resulted in a decreased abundance of several genera belonging to the phylum of Proteobacteria. Plasma malondialdehyde levels and glutathione peroxidase activity showed an improved oxidative status in broilers supplemented with zinc amino acid complexes. In conclusion, zinc supplied in feed as amino acid complex is more readily absorbed, potentially conferring a protective effect on villus epithelial cells in the starter phase."

There is a growing scientific interest in the practice of art, for such activities leave the usual healthcare framework and include the World Health Organization (WHO)'s three dimensions of health. Dance is a universal activity that has been identified as healthy. This scoping review's aim is to study the benefits, modalities and risks of dance for persons with a chronic pathology. The literature research was conducted in English and French, using PubMed and Kinedoc's databases, and keywords related to dance and chronic pathologies. Dance activities that did not involve a dance instructor or a trained health professional were excluded. Studies' location and design, the chosen type of dance, pathologies, the number of subjects, modalities, intended effects and adverse effects were then studied. 51 studies were included in this work. 47.5% were RCTs and 47% originate from North America. The number of published studies is strongly increasing. Sixteen different pathologies were studied, with a large predominance of neurology diseases. Targeted effects were the impacts on mental health, quality of life, physical and motor capacities and pathology-specific symptoms. Dance activities are deemed feasible, and no adverse effects were identified. In the event of chronic pathologies, practicing dance is possible; it is stimulating and effective against sedentariness and its adverse effects. Patient adherence is good, and dance seems to respond to the multidimensional component of chronic diseases, while offering unlimited adaptation to patients' physical and cognitive impairments. There are few studies yet, and their methodological quality is moderate, which is why further research work must confirm dance's interest regarding chronic pathologies."

This zoonotic pandemic is proving to be the most destructive disease outbreaks since decades. The increasing human population and anthropogenic activities have impacted the environment and have direct linkages with the current and other recent outbreaks of zoonotic diseases. Despite having a difference in their origin, major reasons behind the emergence and spread of zoonotic pandemics are related to activities such as habitat fragmentation, deforestation, biodiversity loss, intensive agriculture and livestock farming, uncontrolled urbanization, pollution, climate change and bushmeat hunting and trading. It is important to focus on environmental and climatic factors that are involved in the emergence of such pandemics involving novel human pathogens and viruses in particular. Research and data analysis, particularly in relation to COVID-19, has shown that meteorological factors along with population density and living conditions (particularly in the urban and semi-urban areas) play a crucial role in the intensity, evolution and spread of SARS-CoV-2. This particular virus is novel but coronaviruses have a long history and are known to cause disease outbreaks earlier as well. COVID-19 pandemic provides learning for the future, in particular the importance of environmental sustainability for controlling such outbreaks. A strategic plan can be developed involving policy-makers, organizations, and governments to control the onset and spread of the novel pathogens. This review-based study recommends that prevention of COVID-19 like pandemics from re-occurring is through tackling the issues related to the environment by controlling anthropogenic activities. It will also be important to track the lineage and future evolution course of such human pathogens so as to determine the nexus of environmental and biological factors in the development and spread of novel strains."

After five weeks of being fed by zinc deficient food, zinc deficient rats were divided into four groups randomly receiving medicinal solutions of zinc sulfate, zinc ethyl maltol and zinc methyl maltol using feeding tube method for two weeks while the control was received distilled water. Serum zinc concentration and ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase) and LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase) activity of rats were determined before and after the study. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 11.5. The study was conducted from 2008 to 2010. Serum zinc concentration and enzyme activity in all groups receiving drug solution increased. The most and least increase were in zinc sulfate and zinc methyl maltol groups, respectively. The difference between zinc methyl maltol and zinc sulfate group was significant ( P < 0.05); however, this difference was not significant in the case of zinc ethyl maltol. Zinc ethyl maltol can be a suitable and preferable substitute for zinc sulfate."

This study analyzed pig-PrP C susceptibility to different prion strains using PoPrP-Tg001 mice either as animal bioassay or as substrate for protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA). A panel of isolates representatives of different prion strains was selected, including classic and atypical/Nor98 scrapie, atypical-BSE, rodent scrapie, human Creutzfeldt-Jakob-disease and classic BSE from different species. Bioassay proved that PoPrP-Tg001-mice were susceptible only to the classic BSE agent, and PMCA results indicate that only classic BSE can convert pig-PrP C into scrapie-type PrP (PrP Sc ), independently of the species origin. Therefore, conformational flexibility constraints associated with pig-PrP would limit the number of permissible PrP Sc conformations compatible with pig-PrP C , thus suggesting that pig-PrP C may constitute a paradigm of low conformational flexibility that could confer high resistance to the diversity of prion strains. Experimental transmission in pig cellular prion protein (PrP C ) transgenic mice and in vitro protein misfolding cyclic amplification propagation assay results showed that pig-PrP C is resistant to all tested prion strains except classic bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and it may constitute a paradigm of low susceptibility to prion strain diversity."

Moreover, a significantly higher 10\u2010year Framingham risk for CHD and 10\u2010year risk for ASCVD was observed in both men and women with mildly decreased eGFR (60\u201389\u00a0mL/min per 1.73\u00a0m 2 ). Even mildly reduced eGFR (under 90\u00a0mL/min per 1.73\u00a0m 2 ) is associated with elevated 10\u2010year Framingham risk for CHD and 10\u2010year ASCVD risk among Chinese adults."

        "abstract": "Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA) has been reported as essential to the invasion process and aggressiveness of numerous cancers. However, there are only sparse data on the expression and activity of RhoA in clinically localised prostate cancer. In numerous cancers, tumour cells at the invasive front demonstrate more aggressive behaviour in comparison with the cells in the central regions. In the present study, the expression and activity of RhoA was evaluated in 34 paraffin-embedded and 20 frozen prostate tissue specimens obtained from 45 patients treated with radical prostatectomy for clinically localised cancer. The expression patterns of RhoA were assessed by immunohistochemical staining and western blotting. Additional comparisons were performed between the tumour centre, tumour front and distant peritumoural tissue. RhoA activity was assessed by G-LISA. Associations between RhoA expression and the clinical features and outcome of the patients were also analysed. The present study found an increasing gradient of expression from the centre to the periphery of index tumour foci. RhoA expression was significantly increased at the tumour front compared to the tumour centre, which was determined using immunohistochemistry (P=0.001). Increased RhoA expression was associated with poor tumour differentiation in the tumour front (P=0.044) and tumour centre (P=0.039). Subsequent to a median follow-up period of 52 months, the rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse was increased in patients with higher RhoA expression at the tumour front when compared with patients with lower RhoA expression (62.5 vs. 35.0%), although the difference was not significant (P=0.09). There was no association between RhoA expression and the PSA level or pathological stage in the present study. In conclusion, RhoA expression was increased at the tumour front and was associated with poor tumour differentiation in the tumour front and tumour centre, indicating the potential role of RhoA in prostate cancer. RhoA expression may also act as a prognostic factor in prostate cancer. The present data provide a foundation for novel therapeutic approaches by targeting RhoA in prostate cancer."

Staphylococcal enterotoxins are 23- to 29-kDa polypeptides in the bacterial superantigen protein family. Clinical symptoms from intoxication with staphylococcal enterotoxins vary by exposure route. Ingestion results in gastrointestinal symptoms, and inhalation results in fever as well as pulmonary and gastrointestinal symptoms. Review of occupational exposures at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases from 1989 to 2002 showed that three laboratory workers had symptoms after ocular exposure to staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). Conjunctivitis with localized cutaneous swelling occurred in three persons within 1 to 6 hours after exposure to SEB; two of these persons also had gastrointestinal symptoms, which suggests that such symptoms occurred as a result of exposure by an indirect cutaneous or ocular route. Ocular exposures from SEB resulting in conjunctivitis and localized swelling have not previously been reported. Symptoms from these patients and review of clinical symptoms of 16 laboratory-acquired inhalational SEB intoxications may help healthcare workers evaluate and identify SEB exposures in laboratory personnel at risk."

Finally, the brain\u2013behavior correlations between the EP\u2010 and ER\u2010related areas and depression severity were assessed. We found that: (a) affective areas are regionally and/or connectively disturbed in MDD; (b) EP\u2010ER interaction seems to be disrupted in MDD; overburden of emotional reactivity in amygdala may inversely affect cognitive control processes in prefrontal cortices, which leads to diminished regulatory actions.

The aim of this study was to understand better the water and photoassimilate translocation pathways to and within nodules. The present study shows that in damaged roots LYCH moves apoplastically through the vascular elements but it was not detected within the nodule vascular bundles. In intact roots, the outer cortex was strongly labeled but the dye was not present in the interior of intact root nodules. The inwards movement of LYCH was halted in the endodermis. When the dye was introduced into a damaged nodule by infiltration, it spread only in the cell walls and the intercellular spaces up to the inner cortex. Our research showed that in addition to the outer cortex, the inner tissue containing bacteroid-infected cells is also an apoplastic domain. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that nodules do not receive water from the xylem but get it and photoassimilates from phloem. A comparison between using LYCH and LYCH followed by glutaraldehyde fixation indicates that glutaraldehyde is responsible for fluorescence of some organelles within root nodule cells. The influence of the fixation on nodule fluorescence has not been reported before but must be taken into consideration to avoid errors. An attempt was made to follow carboxyfluorescein (6(5) CF) translocation from leaflets into roots and root nodules. In root nodules, CF was present in all or a couple of vascular bundles (VB), vascular endodermis and some adjacent cells. The leakage of CF from the VBs was observed, which suggests symplastic continuity between the VBs and the nodule parenchyma. The lack of CF in inner tissue was observed. Therefore, photoassimilate entry to the infected region of nodule must involve an apoplastic pathway."

A cross-sectional study was conducted at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (Hospital USM), Health Campus, Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia. Thirty newly diagnosed patients with PCOS attending gynecology clinic between July 2016 and April 2017 were recruited. Fasting venous blood samples were collected from the subjects. Serum AMH, insulin, adiponectin, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and plasma glucose levels were measured, and insulin resistance was calculated based on homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The serum AMH level was estimated, and the correlation of serum AMH level with the metabolic parameters was analyzed. The median of serum AMH levels in women with PCOS was 6.8 ng/mL (interquartile range: 7.38 ng/mL). There was a significant negative correlation between serum AMH and HOMA-IR or triglyceride levels ( r = \u22120.49, P = 0.006 and r = \u22120.55, P = 0.002, respectively). A significant positive correlation was observed between serum AMH and serum HDL-C or serum adiponectin levels ( r = 0.56, P = 0.001 and r = 0.44, P = 0.014, respectively) in all study subjects. The serum AMH level is associated with HOMA-IR, triglycerides, HDL-C, and adiponectin levels, and hence it may be used as a potential cardiometabolic risk marker in women with PCOS."

In recent years, studies have revealed the localization and changes in the density of neuropeptides, such as substance P (SP) in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. This review is a concise overview of SP and their physiologic and pathologic functions on regulating epilepsy, and the underline mechanisms. We research and collect relative online content for reviewing the effects of SP in Epilepsy. The SP/NK-1 receptor system may induce seizures and play an important role in status epilepticus and in experimental animal models of epilepsy. Newest studies show that several mechanisms may explain the excitatory effects of the SP/NK-1 receptor signaling pathway in epilepsy. By binding to the NK-1 receptor, NK-1 receptor antagonists may block the pathophysiological effects of SP, and further studies are needed to confirm the possible anti-epileptic activity of NK-1 receptor antagonists. SP plays crucial roles on through binding with NK-1 receptor during epilepsy pathologic processing, and the NK-1 receptor is receiving a great attention as a therapeutic target for treating epilepsy. Thus, the use of NK-1 receptor antagonists for the treatment of epilepsy should be investigated in further studies."

Human Genetic Analyses: (1) gene set analysis (GSA) of new genome wide association study (GWAS) data for 593 individuals with high myopia (refraction \u2264 -6 diopters [D]); (2) over-representation analysis (ORA) of 196 genes with de novo mutations, identified by whole genome sequencing of 45 high-myopia trio families, and (3) ORA of 284 previously reported myopia risk genes. Contributions of the enriched signaling pathways in mediating the genetic and environmental interactions during myopia development were investigated in vivo and in vitro . All three genetic analyses showed significant enrichment of four KEGG signaling pathways, including amphetamine addiction, extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interaction, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton pathways. In individuals with extremely high myopia (refraction \u2264 -10 D), the GSA of GWAS data revealed significant enrichment of the HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathway. Using human scleral fibroblasts, silencing the key nodal genes within protein-protein interaction networks for the enriched pathways antagonized the hypoxia-induced increase in myofibroblast transdifferentiation. In mice, scleral HIF-1\u03b1 downregulation led to hyperopia, whereas upregulation resulted in myopia. In human subjects, near work, a risk factor for myopia, significantly decreased choroidal blood perfusion, which might cause scleral hypoxia. Our study implicated the HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathway in promoting human myopia through mediating interactions between genetic and environmental factors.

Its derivative, 9-phenylacridine (ACPH) had been found to exhibit antitumor activity both in cell lines and in vivo model. Its DNA binding ability and absorbance in the ultraviolet range encouraged us to investigate its role as a photosensitizer with UVA radiation. We investigated the effects of ACPH prior to UVA exposure on in vitro DNA through photo-cleavage assay. Effect of such treatment was also studied in cultured A375 melanoma cells. Endpoints studied included morphological changes, evaluation of cellular viability, scratch assay, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, glutathione (GSH) level, autophagy, cell cycle progression, depletion of mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8mt), induction of apoptosis and Hoechst dye efflux assay. Our findings indicated that ACPH could sensitize damage to DNA induced by UVA both in vitro and in cells. It could also potentiate cell killing by UVA. It arrested cells in G 2 /M phase and induced apoptotic death through mitochondria mediated pathway. This sensitization was through enhancement of intracellular ROS. Our findings also indicated that the stem cells side population was reduced on such treatment. The findings are important as it indicates ACPH as a promising photosensitizer and indicates its possible role in photodynamic therapy.

The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of 31 patients with septic arthritis of the hip. All of the patients were younger than 18 months old. Follow-up periods ranged from 5 to 17 years. The following potential variables for predicting the prognosis were included in the assessment: gender, age, underlying diseases, duration of symptoms, changes of hip joint in X-ray, concomitant osteomyelitis, elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, sepsis, pus drainage, synovial fluid culture, and infecting organisms. Clinical and radiological prognoses were analyzed at the final follow-up. Univariate analysis demonstrated that radiological prognoses were poorer in patients who had underlying diseases, a longer duration of symptoms, and pus drainage. However, on multivariate analysis, only the variable-duration of symptoms-was found to be statistically related with a poor radiological prognosis. Although poor prognosis for patients with several underlying diseases and radiological changes has already been established, a favorable outcome might be expected with prompt surgical drainage and appropriate antibiotics."

Genetic (also known as familial) acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE1) is a rare disease presenting with encephalopathy often following preceding viral febrile illness in patients with a genetic predisposition resulting from a missense mutation in the gene encoding RAN Binding Protein 2 (RANBP2). The acute episode is characterized by deterioration in consciousness, often with focal neurologic deficits and seizures. Additionally, symmetric multifocal brain lesions are seen in the bilateral thalami as well as other characteristic regions, involving both gray and white matter. Prognosis is variable, with a high mortality rate and most surviving patients having persistent neurologic deficits. Early treatment with high dose steroids is associated with a more favorable outcome, however the diagnosis is often overlooked resulting in delayed treatment. The RANBP2 mutation associated with ANE1 causes an incompletely penetrant predisposition to encephalopathy in the setting of febrile illness through a mechanism that remains elusive. There are several non-mutually exclusive hypotheses suggesting possible etiologies for this phenotype based on the many functions of RANBP2 within the cell. These include dysfunctions in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and intracellular metabolic regulation, as well as cytokine storm, and abnormal distribution of mitochondria. This narrative review explores these key concepts of the RANBP2 mutation and its clinical and therapeutic implications in pediatric populations."

However, much research treats these conditions as a single disorder when they differ significantly in terms of their disease burden. This paper examines the socio-economic pattern of anxiety and depression separately and longitudinally to develop a better understanding of their disease burden for key social groups at different ages. The Twenty-07 Study has followed 4510 respondents from three cohorts in the West of Scotland for 20 years and 3846 respondents had valid data for these analyses. Hierarchical repeated-measures models were used to investigate the relationship between age, social class and the prevalence of anxiety and depression over time measured as scores of 8 or more out of 21 on the relevant subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Social class differences in anxiety and depression widened with age. For anxiety there was a nonlinear decrease in prevalence with age, decreasing more slowly for those from manual classes compared to non-manual, whereas for depression there was a non-linear increase in prevalence with age, increasing more quickly for those from manual classes compared to non-manual. This relationship is robust to cohort, period and attrition effects. The more burdensome disorder of depression occurs more frequently at ages where socio-economic inequalities in mental health are greatest, representing a \u2018double jeopardy\u2019 for older people from a manual class."

        "abstract": "BCG vaccination can strengthen protection against pathogens through the induction of epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells, a process called trained immunity. We and others recently demonstrated that mucosal or intravenous BCG better protects rhesus macaques from Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and TB disease than standard intradermal vaccination, correlating with local adaptive immune signatures. In line with prior mouse data, here, we show in rhesus macaques that intravenous BCG enhances innate cytokine production associated with changes in H3K27 acetylation typical of trained immunity. Alternative delivery of BCG does not alter the cytokine production of unfractionated bronchial lavage cells. However, mucosal but not intradermal vaccination, either with BCG or the M.\u00a0tuberculosis -derived candidate MTBVAC, enhances innate cytokine production by blood- and bone marrow-derived monocytes associated with metabolic rewiring, typical of trained immunity. These results provide support to strategies for improving TB vaccination and, more broadly, modulating innate immunity via mucosal surfaces. Nonhuman primates recapitulate trained immunity upon live attenuated TB vaccination Intravenous BCG induces changes in H3K27 acetylation and enhances cytokine production Mucosal BCG improves induction of trained immunity of monocytes over intradermal BCG The M.\u00a0tuberculosis -derived candidate vaccine MTBVAC appears equally potent as BCG Nonhuman primates recapitulate trained immunity upon live attenuated TB vaccination Intravenous BCG induces changes in H3K27 acetylation and enhances cytokine production Mucosal BCG improves induction of trained immunity of monocytes over intradermal BCG The M.\u00a0tuberculosis -derived candidate vaccine MTBVAC appears equally potent as BCG Vierboom et\u00a0al. demonstrate the induction of trained immunity in blood and bone marrow monocytes after vaccination with live attenuated TB vaccines in nonhuman primates. Mucosal respiratory delivery of BCG or MTBVAC induces trained immunity more efficiently compared to standard intradermal vaccination."

Psychiatric manifestations of pemphigus vulgaris are generally described secondary to steroid and immunosuppressant therapy though recent studies highlight independent association of pemphigus with psychotic disorders. We describe a unique development of Lilliputian hallucinations, their transformation into Brobdingnagian hallucinations on treatment with steroids and gradual resolution back to Lilliputian status on treatment with risperidone. Earlier Lilliputian hallucinations have been described in a case of Charles Bonnet syndrome, Balint syndrome, alcohol withdrawal delirium, head injury and dementia. This unique phenomenon carries it significance in the literature from psychopathological perspective."

Isoxazolones are considered bioisosteric analogues of pyrazolones and may have comparable properties. Thus, we investigated the structural and electronic influences for edaravone, isoxazolone, and their tautomers on antioxidant process. Structure and tautomerism study among edaravone, isoxazolone and their heterocycles derivatives were related to antioxidant mechanisms by using the hybrid DFT method B3LYP with the basis sets 6-31++G(2d,2p). The C\u2014H tautomer was the most stable and energetically favored among them. Intramolecular N\u2014H\u2014N hydrogen bonds and polar medium were responsible for the low energy differences among all possible tautomers. N\u2014H tautomers in both systems proved to be better antioxidant by SET (single electron transfer), while O\u2014H tautomers were better antioxidant on HAT (homolytic hydrogen atom transfer) mechanism. Theoretical calculation showed that edaravone is more potent than phenylisoxazolone, however, both has similar antioxidant scavenging on experimental DPPH. The carbonyliminic system played a very important role in the antioxidant activity for both studied classes."

We developed and evaluated an immunoglobulin Y (IgY)-based ELISA to measure total PSA (tPSA) concentrations in human serum that could be used as an alternative to commercially available in vitro diagnostic assays that rely on mouse monoclonal IgG. A sandwich ELISA based on an anti-PSA IgY antibody was developed. We evaluated the ability of the anti-PSA IgY antibody to detect free and complexed PSA at the same molar ratio. The assay was optimized, and its analytical performance was verified by calculating limit of background (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantification (LoQ). We performed correlation and regression analyses between tPSA concentrations measured by our ELISA and those from commercial assays: Cobas 6000 (Roche Diagnostics, Warszawa, Poland) and PSA total ELISA (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany). LoB, LoD, and LoQ, were 0.061, 0.083, and 0.100 ng/mL, respectively, and linearity range was 0.100\u20133.375 ng/mL. tPSA concentrations from our IgY-based ELISA strongly correlated with those from the commercial assays. Our IgY-based ELISA is an efficient equivalent to the above commercial assays. The use of IgY as the detecting agent could reduce the risk of false positive results, as well as decrease the overall cost of analysis."

This study aims to evaluate the characteristics of trunk musculature and intervertebral discs by using magnetic resonance imaging in patients with spinal cord injuries (SCIs) with thoracic and lumbar fractures. Muscle atrophy is an immediate consequence of SCI and is associated with secondary complications. At present, there are limited clinical data on muscle and disc responses to fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine. A total of 51 patients with a mean age of 31.75\u00b110.42 years who suffered traumatic SCI were included in this study. Complete neurological examinations (American Spinal Injury Association grading) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed at the time of admission and at 3\u20136 months after injury to study the neurological status and disc and trunk parameters. The type of management (operative or conservative) was decided on the basis of clinical, radiological, and MRI evaluations, and a robust rehabilitation program was initiated. Disc parameters including disc angle, skin angle, cross-sectional area (CSA), and disc height and trunk parameters (mean trunk width, mean trunk depth, and CSA of the lumbar muscles) decreased significantly (p <0.001) during the first 3 months after SCI. However, improvements were observed in disc and muscle parameters at the 6-month follow-up, but these parameters did not return to normal levels. Neither initial neurological status (complete vs. incomplete) nor type of management (operative vs. conservative) had a significant effect on these parameters. Spinal trauma leads to alterations in the morphology of the vertebral column, spinal cord, intervertebral discs, and paraspinal muscles in the initial phase of injury. The extent of these changes may determine the initial neurological deficit and subsequent recovery. Although this study did not identify any statistically significant effect of neurological status or management strategy on these parameters, rehabilitation was found to result in the improvement of these parameters in the later phase of recovery. Future studies are required to evaluate the exact causes of these alterations and the potential benefits of rehabilitation strategies and to minimize these changes."

To improve uptake of surgical services among this group, evidence regarding the problems of access is vital. Barriers in accessing eye care services have previously been reported but not specific to bilaterally cataract blind patients. Further, there is a gap in knowledge regarding factors facilitating access to eye care. Our aims were to (1) report proportion of bilaterally cataract blind patients undergoing surgery and sight restoration rate (SRR) and (2) analyze barriers and factors enabling access to eye care services among bilaterally cataract blind patients. Retrospective analysis of interview and clinical data of bilaterally cataract blind patients undergoing surgery through outreach services at the base hospital, from June 2015 to May 2016, was performed. Demographic data, vision, postoperative visual outcomes, barriers, and facilitating factors in accessing cataract surgical services were obtained. Bilateral cataract blindness was present in 196/3178 (6.2%, 95% confidence interval 5.4\u20137.06) patients. SRR was 6.5%. Fear of surgery (24.2%) and lack of family support/escort (22.9%) were the most common barriers. Neighbors and acquaintances (28.6%), general health workers (20.2%), and persons who had undergone cataract surgery (19.6%) were the most common facilitating factors. Proportion of bilaterally cataract blind people undergoing surgery and consequently SRR were low. The most common barriers were at the individual level while facilitating factors at the community level were instrumental in promoting uptake of services. Interventions involving community-based support for the blind may be useful in overcoming barriers to eye care."

In spite of the importance of intestinal bacteria translocation in these infections, information about the effect of high-dose chemotherapy on gut mucosal immunity is minimal. We studied prophylactic ciprofloxacin (Cipro) treatment on irinotecan (CPT-11) toxicity and host immunity in rats bearing Ward colon tumour. Cipro abolished chemotherapy-related mortality, which was 45% in animals that were not treated with Cipro. Although Cipro reduced body weight loss and muscle wasting, it was unable to prevent severe late-onset diarrhoea. Seven days after CPT-11, splenocytes were unable to proliferate (stimulation index=0.10\u00b10.02) and produce proliferative and inflammatory cytokines (i.e., Interleukin (IL)-2, interferon- \u03b3 (IFN- \u03b3 ), tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF- \u03b1 ) IL-1 \u03b2 , IL-6) on mitogen stimulation in vitro ( P <0.05 vs controls), whereas mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells showed a hyper-proliferative response and a hyper-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines on mitogen stimulation. This suggests compartmentalised effects by CPT-11 chemotherapy on systemic and intestinal immunity. Cipro normalised the hyper-responsiveness of MLN cells, and in the spleen, it partially restored the proliferative response and normalised depressed production of IL-1 \u03b2 and IL-6. Taken together, Cipro prevented infectious challenges associated with immune hypo-responsiveness in systemic immune compartments, and it may also alleviate excessive pro-inflammatory responses mediating local gut injury."

GHB was used clinically as an anesthetic in the 1960s but was withdrawn due to side effects that included seizures and coma. GHB has been implicated in a number of crime types; most notably in drug-facilitated sexual assault. GHB is abused by three main groups of users: Body builders who use the substance believing that it stimulated the release of growth hormone; sexual predators who covertly administer the drug for its sedative and amnesic effects and club-goers (rave parties) who take the drug for its euphoric effects. The short-lived hypnotic effects, relative safety and widespread availability of the drug have made it particularly well suited to this role. The drug has an addictive potential if used for long term. The primary effects of GHB use are those of a CNS depressant and therefore range from relaxation, to euphoria, confusion, amnesia, hallucinations, and coma. Despite the increased regulation, GHB remains widely available through the Internet where one can easily purchase the necessary reagents as well as recipes for home production. There are reports of patients being unresponsive to painful stimuli and cases of oral self-mutilations linked to the abuse of GHB, though quiet rare. Such cases should remind odontologists that intra-oral lesions may be the result of self-mutilation either due to mental illness or altered states caused by the use of prescription or non-prescription drugs."

        "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming of tumour cells sustains cancer progression. Similar to other cancer cells, glioblastoma cells exhibit an increased glycolytic flow, which encourages the use of antiglycolytics as an effective complementary therapy. We used the antiglycolytic 3-bromopyruvate (3BP) as a metabolic modifier to treat U118 glioblastoma cells and investigated the toxic effects and the conditions to increase drug effectiveness at the lowest concentration. Cellular vitality was not affected by 3BP concentrations lower than 40 \u03bcM, although p-Akt dephosphorylation, p53 degradation, and ATP reduction occurred already at 30 \u03bcM 3BP. ROS generated in mitochondria were enhanced at 30 \u03bcM 3BP, possibly by unbalancing their generation and their disposal because of glutathione peroxidase inhibition. ROS triggered JNK and ERK phosphorylation, and cyt c release outside mitochondria, not accompanied by caspases-9 and -3 activation, probably due to 3BP-dependent alkylation of cysteine residues at caspase-9 catalytic site. To explore the possibility of sensitizing cells to 3BP treatment, we exploited 3BP effects on mitochondria by using 30 \u03bcM 3BP in association with antimycin A or menadione concentrations that in themselves exhibit poor toxicity. 3BP effect on cyt c release and cell vitality loss was potentiated due the greater oxidative stress induced by antimycin or menadione association with 3BP, supporting a preeminent role of mitochondrial ROS in 3BP toxicity. Indeed, the scavenger of mitochondrial superoxide MitoTEMPO counteracted 3BP-induced cyt c release and weakened the potentiating effect of 3BP/antimycin association. In conclusion, the biochemical mechanisms leading U118 glioblastoma cells to viability loss following 3BP treatment rely on mitochondrial ROS-dependent pathways. Their potentiation at low 3BP concentrations is consistent with the goal to minimize the toxic effect of the drug towards non-cancer cells.

Furthermore, it has found application in combination with other drugs in the dermatological field and in pre-clinical studies in animal models of osteoarthritis. Experimental evidence suggests that a combination of this macromolecule with other drugs may act as a slow-release depot. However, to date, to the best of our knowledge, no one has tested local intra-articular delivery of highly cross-linked hyaluronic acid combined with bisphosphonate or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for management of knee osteoarthritis pain in the clinical setting. The aim of the present randomized double-blind study was to investigate, for the first time, the effect of a highly cross-linked hyaluronic acid, Variofill \u00ae , alone or in combination with diclofenac sodium or sodium clodronate, for management of bilateral knee osteoarthritis-related pain. Sixty-two patients with symptomatic bilateral medial tibiofemoral knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren\u2013Lawrence grade II and III) and pain in both knees corresponding to a daily visual analog scale (VAS) score \u2265 30 in the month before the beginning of the study were included in this investigation. Patients were divided into three groups: group 1, treated with an injection of hyaluronic acid alone (66 mg) into each knee; group 2, treated with an injection of hyaluronic acid (49.5 mg) plus diclofenac sodium (5 mg) into each knee; group 3, treated with an injection of hyaluronic acid (49.5 mg) plus sodium clodronate (5 mg) into each knee. Patients also underwent blood tests for measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) immediately before and at 6-month follow-up. Hyaluronic acid alone and in combination with sodium clodronate or diclofenac sodium produced a significant improvement in mean VAS pain score at 3 and 6-month follow-up. At 6-month follow-up, therapy with hyaluronic acid plus sodium clodronate was the most beneficial in terms of percentage improvement in VAS pain score. A significant improvement in ESR and CRP was observed at 6-month follow-up in each treatment group. No significant difference was observed when the percentage change from baseline related to these parameters was compared among the groups. No dropout was observed in any group. No serious adverse events were observed. Further studies are necessary to determine the effect of a therapy based on hyaluronic acid combined with diclofenac sodium or sodium clodronate in larger cohorts of patients affected by knee osteoarthritis and in longer-term follow-up."

The aim of this study is to determine the mean CCT among a normal Iraqi population and to correlate between CCT and age, gender, refraction, and corneal curvature. This cross-sectional study was carried out at Ibn Al-Haitham Teaching Eye Hospital. A total of 418 eyes from 209 healthy individuals with an age range from 20 to 75 years were studied. CCT was measured by ultrasound pachymeter. Refraction was measured using an auto-refractor and confirmed by trial lenses and retinoscopy to calculate the spherical equivalent. Corneal curvature was measured using an auto-refracto-keratometer to calculate the average corneal curvature (AVK). The mean CCT was 543.95\u00b132.58 \u03bcm with a range from 422 to 636 \u03bcm. CCT was not affected by gender. CCT significantly negatively correlated with age and AVK. CCT significantly positively correlated with the spherical equivalence. Among an Iraqi population, CCT significantly decreased with age. Myopics had significantly thinner corneas. There was weak but significant negative correlation between CCT and corneal curvature. We recommend further studies about the relationship between central corneal thickness and other ocular parameters in Iraqi population such as the axial length."

The precise circuits through which aversive states are orchestrated by 5-HT, however, have not yet been defined. Here we show that 5-HT from the dorsal raphe nucleus (5-HT DRN ) enhances fear and anxiety and activates a subpopulation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (CRF BNST ). Specifically, 5-HT DRN projections to the BNST, via actions at 5-HT 2C receptors (5-HT 2C Rs), engage a CRF BNST inhibitory microcircuit that silences anxiolytic BNST outputs to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and lateral hypothalamus (LH). Further, we demonstrate that this CRF BNST inhibitory circuit underlies aversive behavior following acute exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This early aversive effect is mediated via the corticotrophin releasing factor type 1 receptor (CRF 1 R) given that CRF 1 R antagonism is sufficient to prevent acute SSRI-induced enhancements in aversive learning. These results reveal an essential 5-HT DRN \u2192CRF BNST circuit governing fear and anxiety and provide a potential mechanistic explanation for the clinical observation of early adverse events to SSRI treatment in some patients with anxiety disorders 1 , 2 ."

        "abstract": "We tested the impacts of food availability and water temperature on Striped Marsh Frog survivorship, growth and development. Tadpole size was largest, and survivorship lowest, at warmer temperatures. Food availability mediated the effects of temperature, with smaller tadpole size and higher survivorship in stochastic food availability treatments. Food availability and temperature are known to trigger phenotypic change, but the interactive effects between these factors are only beginning to be considered. The aim of this study was to examine the independent and interactive effects of long-term stochastic food availability and water temperature on larval survivorship, growth and development of the striped marsh frog, Limnodynastes peronii . Larval L. peronii were reared in conditions of either constant or stochastic food availability and in water at three different temperatures (18, 22 and 26\u00b0C), and effects on survival, growth and development were quantified. Over the experimental period, larval growth rate was highest and survivorship lowest at the warmest temperature. However, changes in food availability mediated the effects of temperature, with slower larval growth and higher survivorship in stochastic food availability treatments. Tadpoles in the stochastic food availability treatments did not reach metamorphosis during the experimental period, suggesting that developmental stasis may have been induced by food restriction. Overall, these results demonstrate that changes in food availability alter the effects of water temperature on survival, growth and development. From an applied perspective, understanding how environmental factors interact to cause phenotypic change may assist with amphibian conservation by improving the number of tadpoles generated in captive breeding programmes."

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the role of deep cryogenic treatment (DCT) on the cyclic fatigue resistance and cutting efficiency of martensitic shape memory (SM) nickel\u2013titanium (NiTi) rotary endodontic instruments. Seventy-five HyFlex \u00ae CM instruments were randomly divided into three groups of 25 each and subjected to different DCT (\u2013185\u00b0 C) conditions based on soaking time: DCT 24 group: 24 h, DCT 6 group: 6 h, and control group. Each group was randomly subdivided for evaluation of cyclic fatigue resistance in custom-made artificial canals ( n = 15) and cutting efficiency in plexiglass simulators ( n = 10). The cyclic fatigue resistance was measured by calculating the number of cycles to failure (NCF) and cutting efficiency was measured using the loss of weight method. Increase in NCF of instruments in DCT 24 group was highly significant ( P < 0.01; Tukey's honest significant difference). There was no difference in weight loss of plexiglass simulators in all the groups ( P > 0.05; one-way analysis of variance). In conclusion, deep dry cryogenic treatment with 24 h soaking time significantly increases the cyclic fatigue resistance without affecting the cutting efficiency of SM NiTi endodontic instruments.

Healthy female college going students (N=186, sportswomen, 90; controls 96) in the age group of 18-21 yr, residing in New Delhi (India) were evaluated for anthropometry, biochemistry (serum total and ionic calcium, phosphorus, total alkaline phosphatase, 25-hydroxyvitamin D & parathyroid hormone), diet, physical activity and lifestyle. Bone mineral density (BMD) at hip, forearm and lumbar spine were studied using central DXA. Sports related physical activity (3 vs. 0 h/day, P <0.001) and direct sunlight exposure (120 vs. 30 min/day, P <0.001) were significantly higher in sportswomen than in controls with sedentary lifestyle. Significantly higher intake of all macronutrients (energy, protein, carbohydrates and fat) and dietary calcium was noted in the diets of sportswomen. Mean serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly higher (53.0\u00b118.9 vs. 12.9\u00b17.7 nmol/l; P <0.001) while PTH (35.3\u00b117.6 vs. 51.7\u00b144.9 pg/ml; P <0.001) and ALP levels (194.0\u00b151.0 vs. 222.1\u00b151.4 IU/l; P <0.001) were significantly lower in sportswomen when compared to controls. No significant difference was found in ionized calcium and inorganic phosphorus in the two groups. Significantly higher ( P <0.001) total BMD and BMD at all sites except femur neck were found in sportswomen than controls ( P <0.001). Physical activity, optimal nutrition and adequate sun exposure are vital for attaining peak bone mass."

To evaluate the influence of HK L-137 on chronic inflammation in mice with diet-induced obesity, C57BL/6\u2005J mice were fed a normal diet (16% of energy as fat) or a high-fat diet (62% of energy as fat) with or without 0.002% HK L-137 for 4 to 20 weeks. It was found that HK L-137 supplementation alleviated weight gain and elevation of plasma glucose, cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate transaminase levels in mice with diet-induced obesity. Expression of several inflammation-related genes, including F4/80, CD11c, and IL-1\u03b2, in the epididymal adipose tissue of these mice was significantly downregulated by HK L-137. In addition, plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, a marker of endotoxemia, tended to be decreased by administration of HK L-137. These findings suggest that HK L-137 supplementation ameliorates obesity-induced metabolic abnormalities and adipose tissue inflammation, possibly through improvement of intestinal permeability."

Significant positive associations were found between stress and increase in Internet use for interpersonal communication and online errands. Linear regression analysis revealed a significant negative association between stress and subjective wellbeing, but it was only increased Internet use for leisure that associated significantly with enhanced wellbeing. The changes in Internet use clearly reflected coping efforts that were apparently ineffective in enhancing wellbeing. Paradoxically, the only online functions that could improve wellbeing, Internet use for leisure, are precisely those whose use hardly increased."

The aims of the present study were to translate and validate the Rome III diagnostic questionnaire which was widely used in Western countries. The original version of Rome III diagnostic questionnaire was translated from English into Japanese through 3 independent forward translations, resolution, back translation and reconciliation of the differences. Forty-nine patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 32 patients with functional dyspepsia (FD) and 56 subjects without any current GI symptoms as controls were recruited from three hospitals located in different regions of Japan and completed the IBS and FD diagnostic modules twice within 14 days. Kappa statistic was used to assess test-retest reliability. The sensitivity and specificity of each diagnostic module for distinguishing IBS or FD patients from controls was tested. Median kappa statistics were 0.63 for the translated IBS diagnostic module and 0.68 for the FD module. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predict value of the IBS module against physician diagnosis was 61.2%, 100%, and 100% and those of the FD module was 53.2%, 98.2%, and 94.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, IBS patients were significantly more likely to report blood in stools compared to controls (18.4% vs 1.8%, P < 0.01). The IBS and FD diagnostic modules on the Japanese version of the Rome III diagnostic questionnaire are valid and reliable. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the diagnostic utility of the red flag questionnaire."

However, the mechanisms that cause such damage are not well-understood. The aim of this study is to detect the expression of apoptosis-related Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3 and Insulin-like growth Factor-I proteins in the hippocampus region in the Predatory stress rats. A total of 70 male wistar rats were divided into Predatory stress groups of 1d, 2d, 3d, 7d, 14d, 30d and a normal control group (N = 10). Rats were subjected to 5 min of predatory stress and then exposed to the elevated plus-maze (EPM). Serum corticosterone and Insulin-like growth factor-1 level of Hippocampus were measured by ELISA technique. The expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase-3 were detected by western blotting. Rats spent significantly more time in closed arms of the elevated plus maze (EPM) than control group after exposure to stress. Serum levels of corticosterone significantly increased at 2d-3d. The expression of hippocampal IGF-1 was significantly up-regulated at 1d-2d after stress. Both Bax and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 significantly peaked at Predatory stress 2d-14d. Caspase3 was significantly active among 2d-30 compared to the normal control. The activation of caspase-3 in the stress groups indicates that apoptosis may be one of the reasons inducing hippocampus atrophy and play roles in the pathogenesis of PTSD. Increase in hippocampus levels of IGF-1 during early PTSD might be involved in the early molecular inhibitory mechanism of apoptosis in PTSD."

To characterise the genetic variability of Aureobasidium pullulans strains originating from the Arctic and  strains originating pan-globally, a multilocus molecular analysis was  performed, through rDNA (internal transcribed spacers, partial 28 S rDNA), and  partial introns and exons of genes encoding \u03b2-tubulin ( TUB ),  translation elongation factor ( EF1\u03b1 ) and elongase  ( ELO ). Two globally ubiquitous varieties were distinguished: var. pullulans , occurring particularly in slightly osmotic substrates and  in the phyllosphere; and var. melanogenum , mainly isolated from  watery habitats. Both varieties were commonly isolated from the sampled Arctic  habitats. However, some aureobasidium-like strains from subglacial ice from  three different glaciers in Kongsfjorden (Svalbard, Spitsbergen), appeared to  represent a new variety of A. pullulans. A strain from dolomitic  marble in Namibia was found to belong to yet another variety. No molecular  support has as yet been found for the previously described var. aubasidani . A partial elongase-encoding gene was successfully used as  a phylogenetic marker at the (infra-)specific level."

Endoplasmic reticulum stress may be involved in mitochondrial mediated neuronal apoptosis. Therefore, endoplasmic reticulum stress has become an important mechanism of secondary injury after traumatic brain injury. In this study, a rat model of traumatic brain injury was established by lateral fluid percussion injury. Fluorescence assays were used to measure reactive oxygen species content in the cerebral cortex. Western blot assays were used to determine expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to detect pathological changes in the cerebral cortex. Transmission electron microscopy was used to measure ultrastructural changes in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Our results showed activation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress-related unfolded protein response. Meanwhile, both the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway were activated at different stages post-traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, pretreatment with the endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor, salubrinal (1 mg/kg), by intraperitoneal injection 30 minutes before injury significantly inhibited the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and reduced apoptosis. Moreover, salubrinal promoted recovery of mitochondrial function and inhibited activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway post-traumatic brain injury. These results suggest that endoplasmic reticulum stress might be a key factor for secondary brain injury post-traumatic brain injury."

The initial masses in RCC patients are mostly confined to a single organ. However, due to the metastatic spread of cancer cells through the circulatory system, more than 30% of RCC patients relapse after surgery. The appearance of distant metastases often means that patients enter the advanced stage of cancer with low quality of life and a short expected survival time. This review aims to describe the extant research on advanced RCC, including its pathophysiology, heterogeneity, diagnosis, treatment, and prospects.

Endoscopic features range from normal appearing esophageal mucosa to features similar to those seen in eosinophilic esophagitis, including esophageal rings, linear furrows, whitish exudates, and esophageal strictures/stenosis. Symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease is an inconsistent association. LyE has been associated in paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease, and recently in primary esophageal dysmotility disorder in adults. There are no studies assessing effective treatment strategies for LyE; empirical therapies have included use of proton pump inhibitor and corticosteroids. Esophageal dilatation have been used to manage esophageal strictures. LyE has been reported to run a benign course; however there has been a case of esophageal perforation associated with LyE.

        "abstract": "The innate immune response is, in the first place, elicited at the site of infection. Thus, the host response can be different among the infected cells and the cells surrounding them. Effector-triggered immunity (ETI), a form of innate immunity in plants, is triggered by specific recognition between pathogen effectors and their corresponding plant cytosolic immune receptors, resulting in rapid localized cell death known as hypersensitive response (HR). HR cell death is usually limited to a few cells at the infection site, and is surrounded by a few layers of cells massively expressing defense genes such as Pathogenesis-Related Gene 1 ( PR1 ). This virtually concentric pattern of the cellular responses in ETI is proposed to be regulated by a concentration gradient of salicylic acid (SA), a phytohormone accumulated around the infection site. Recent studies demonstrated that jasmonic acid (JA), another phytohormone known to be mutually antagonistic to SA in many cases, is also accumulated in and required for ETI, suggesting that ETI is a unique case. However, the molecular basis for this uniqueness remained largely to be solved. Here, we found that, using intravital time-lapse imaging, the JA signaling pathway is activated in the cells surrounding the central SA-active cells around the infection sites in Arabidopsis thaliana . This distinct spatial organization explains how these two phythormone pathways in a mutually antagonistic relationship can be activated simultaneously during ETI. Our results re-emphasize that the spatial consideration is a key strategy to gain mechanistic insights into the apparently complex signaling cross-talk in immunity."

        "abstract": "The present study investigated the influence of granule size of 2 biphasic bone substitutes (BoneCeramic\u00ae 400\u2013700\u00a0\u03bcm and 500\u20131000\u00a0\u03bcm) on the induction of multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs) and implant bed vascularization in a subcutaneous implantation model in rats. Furthermore, degradation mechanisms and particle phagocytosis of both materials were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both granule types induced tissue reactions involving primarily mononuclear cells and only small numbers of MNGCs. Higher numbers of MNGCs were detected in the group with small granules starting on day 30, while higher vascularization was observed only at day 10 in this group. TEM analysis revealed that both mono- and multinucleated cells were involved in the phagocytosis of the materials. Additionally, the results allowed recognition of the MNGCs as the foreign body giant cell phenotype. Histomorphometrical analysis of the size of phagocytosed particles showed no differences between the 2 granule types. The results indicate that granule size seems to have impact on early implant bed vascularization and also on the induction of MNGCs in the late phase of the tissue reaction. Furthermore, the results revealed that a synthetic bone substitute material can induce tissue reactions similar to those of some xenogeneic materials, thus pointing to a need to elucidate their \u201cideal\u201d physical characteristics. The results also show that granule size in the range studied did not alter phagocytosis by mononuclear cells. Finally, the investigation substantiates the differentiation of material-induced MNGCs, which are of the foreign body giant cell type."

        "abstract": "Loneliness may be a consequence of social distancing, a measure imposed by several governments to try to reduce the contagion of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite being necessary, this measure may have thus caused a rise in mental health issues, leading to higher psychological distress and symptomatology. Thus, it is also important to explore how loneliness relates to the regulation of psychological needs. This study aims to explore the relationships between loneliness, symptomatology, and the regulation of psychological needs. 142 individuals (M age=32.7, SD=10.9), answered self-report questionnaires in a cross-sectional design. Results show that loneliness is positively correlated with symptomatology and difficulties in the regulation of psychological needs, with these relationships being mediated by psychological distress and psychological well-being. We discuss our results with a focus on loneliness and related psychopathological symptomatology, as they seem to be core factors in the regulation of psychological needs."

Currently, a knowledge gap exists regarding the knowledge, attitude, and perception towards epilepsy among graduate students. The objectives of the study were to initially explore the knowledge, attitude, practices and to examine their inter-relationship among graduate students. A total of 300 3 rd year Bachelor of Science graduate students from colleges near Hombegowda nagar, Bangalore, Karnataka were included from three colleges. To achieve the objective mentioned, an instrument was framed and approved by specialists in the field. About 26% believed that epilepsy is a mental illness, 64% reported that it is not a disease of the brain, 96% believed it to be a hereditary disease. Attitude shows that 29%, 33%, and 49% believed that Epilepsy can disturb anybody's normal life, education, and occupation, respectively. About 31% reported that if they see a person with epileptic attack they ran away. Knowledge score have significantly ( P < 0.001) positive correlation of r = 0.810 and r = 0.794 with both attitude and practice, respectively. Attitude and practice also have significantly ( P < 0.001) positive correlation (0.856) with practice. This clearly shows that if knowledge increases, persons will have positive attitude and good practices whereas less knowledge leads to faulty attitude and practices. There is a need to include health education programs for school children and college students irrespective of streams, as it is crucial to bring an alteration in the presently observed perspective, behavior, and practice."

        "abstract": "Primate multisensory object perception involves distributed brain regions. To investigate the network character of these regions of the human brain, we applied data-driven group spatial independent component analysis (ICA) to a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data set acquired during a passive audio-visual (AV) experiment with common object stimuli. We labeled three group-level independent component (IC) maps as auditory (A), visual (V), and AV, based on their spatial layouts and activation time courses. The overlap between these IC maps served as definition of a distributed network of multisensory candidate regions including superior temporal, ventral occipito-temporal, posterior parietal and prefrontal regions. During an independent second fMRI experiment, we explicitly tested their involvement in AV integration. Activations in nine out of these twelve regions met the max-criterion (A\u00a0<\u00a0AV\u00a0>\u00a0V) for multisensory integration. Comparison of this approach with a general linear model-based region-of-interest definition revealed its complementary value for multisensory neuroimaging. In conclusion, we estimated functional networks of uni- and multisensory functional connectivity from one dataset and validated their functional roles in an independent dataset. These findings demonstrate the particular value of ICA for multisensory neuroimaging research and using independent datasets to test hypotheses generated from a data-driven analysis.

IAD usually occurs in the posterior circulation, and is relatively rare in the anterior circulation including the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Various surgical and endovascular methods to reduce blood flow in the dissected lesion have been proposed, but no optimum treatment has been established. An 80-year-old woman with dissection in the M1 portion of the MCA manifesting as SAH presented with repeated hemorrhage and cerebral infarction in the area of the inferior trunk of the MCA. High-flow bypass to the MCA was performed and the dissecting lesion was trapped. Prevention of repeated hemorrhage was achieved, and blood flow was preserved to the lenticulostriate artery as well as the MCA area distal to the lesion. Treatment strategy for IAD of the MCA should be planned for each patient and condition, and surgery should be performed promptly to prevent critical rebleeding given the high recurrence rate. In addition, preventing re-rupture of the IAD, and preserving important perforators around the lesion and blood flow distal to the dissection should be targeted by the treatment strategy."

        "abstract": "Although the standard treatment for the patients with recurrent and metastatic prostate cancer (CaP) is androgen deprivation therapy, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) eventually emerges. Our previous report indicated that bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6) induced CRPC via tumour-infiltrating macrophages. In a separate line of study, we have observed that the WNT5A/BMP6 loop in CaP bone metastasis mediates resistance to androgen deprivation in tissue culture. Simultaneously, we have reported that BMP6 induced castration resistance in CaP cells via tumour-infiltrating macrophages. Therefore, our present study aims to investigate the mechanism of WNT5A and its interaction with macrophages on CRPC. Doxycycline inducible WNT5A overexpression prostate cancer cell line was used for detailed mechanical study. WNT5A was associated with increased expression of chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) in the human CaP cell line, LNCaP. Mechanistically, this induction of CCL2 by WNT5A is likely to be mediated via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling pathway. Our in vivo experiments demonstrated that the overexpression of WNT5A in LNCaP cells promoted castration resistance. Conversely, this resistance was inhibited with the removal of macrophages via clodronate liposomes. When patient-derived CaP LuCaP xenografts were analysed, high levels of WNT5A were correlated with increased levels of CCL2 and BMP6. In addition, higher levels of CCL2 and BMP6 were more commonly observed in intra-femoral transplanted tumours as compared to subcutaneous-transplanted tumours in the patient-derived PCSD1 bone-niche model. These findings collectively suggest that WNT5A may be a key gene that induces CRPC in the bone niche by recruiting and regulating macrophages through CCL2 and BMP6, respectively."

Imported malaria in Canada has not been examined recently in the context of increased international mobility, which may influence incidence of imported and autochthonous cases. Surveillance of imported cases can highlight high-risk populations and help target prevention and control measures. To identify geographic and individual determinants of malaria incidence in Ontario, Canada, we conducted a descriptive spatial analysis. We then compared characteristics of case-patients and controls. Case-patients were significantly more likely to be male and live in low-income neighborhoods that had a higher proportion of residents who had emigrated from malaria-endemic regions. This method\u2019s usefulness in clarifying the local patterns of imported malaria in Ontario shows its potential to help identify areas and populations at highest risk for imported and emerging infectious disease."

Rhamnetin possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. This study aimed to detect the possible effects of rhamnetin on cognitive deficit, hippocampal inflammatory factors, and oxidative stress in rats with TBI. In this study, we established the traumatic brain injury model in rats. Rats respectively received vehicle saline or rhamnetin for 21 days. Cognitive functions were evaluated by assessing the acquisition of spatial learning and memory retention in Morris Water Maze test from day 15 to 19 post TBI. Levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a), IL-10, and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) in hippocampal homogenate were measured using ELISA. Oxidative stress was analysed by investigating the activities of MDA, H2O2, SOD, and GSH-Px. We found that rhamnetin significantly improved cognitive impairment in rats with TBI, and inhibited the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in the hippocampus. The results suggested that rhamnetin could enhance the recovery of cognitive deficits induced by TBI, and that its mechanism might be associated with the inhibition of inflammation and oxidative stress in the hippocampus."

However, the mechanisms and key molecules that mediate the effects of EVs on lymphocytes are unclear. Patients and methods: We used Quantibody \u00ae Human Cytokine Antibody Array 440 to determine the tumor immunity-related cytokine profile of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) stimulated with EVs derived from peritoneal washes or malignant ascites. We detected 21 upregulated and 27 downregulated proteins, including the immunosuppressive receptors Siglec-10, SLAM, PD-1, and TIM-3. Results: Flow cytometry analysis of PBLs or ovarian cancer ascites suggested that Siglec-10 expression on CD3+ T cells was higher in ovarian cancer patients than in healthy controls and in the malignant ascites of ovarian cancer patients than in their blood. Moreover, the expression of CD24, the Siglec-10 ligand, was associated with tumor stage and cancer cell metastasis. Finally, compared to the benign peritoneal wash-derived EVs, the malignant EVs significantly upregulated Siglec-10 expression on Jurkat T cells, inhibited the protein kinase C activity induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, and impaired the phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 activated by crosslinking with an anti-CD3 antibody. Conclusion: The EVs secreted by malignant ovarian cells upregulated Siglec-10 expression on T cells and impaired T cell activation in the tumor microenvironment. We believe that a comprehensive understanding of the regulation of Siglec-10 and CD24 by malignant EVs has clinical importance, as it will aid in the development of better immunotherapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer."

Chromogranin A (CGA) is a widely used tissue and serum marker in neuroendocrine tumors. Our aim was to evaluate serum CGA (sCGA) concentrations and their associations with clinical and follow-up data in BC and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). sCGA concentrations were analyzed in the following cohorts: (1) BC training set ( n =\u2009188), (2) BC validation set ( n =\u2009125), (3) RCC patients ( n =\u200977), (4) healthy controls ( n =\u200997). CGA immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR analyses were performed in 20 selected FFPE and 29 frozen BC tissue samples. Acquired data were correlated with clinicopathological parameters including comorbidities with known effect on sCGA as well as with patients\u2019 follow-up data. sCGA levels were significantly higher in BC but not in RCC patients compared to healthy controls. High sCGA levels were independently associated with poor overall and disease-specific survival both in the BC training ( P <\u20090.001, P =\u20090.002) and validation set ( P =\u20090.009, P =\u20090.017). sCGA levels were inversely correlated with glomerulus filtrating rate (GFR) and linearly correlated with creatinine clearance and urea concentrations. These correlations were not related to the prognostic value of sCGA. Tissue CGA levels were low to absent independently of sCGA concentrations. Our results demonstrate elevated levels and an independent prognostic value for sCGA in BC but not in RCC. Despite the significant correlation between sCGA and GFR, the prognostic relevance of sCGA seems not related to impaired renal function or other comorbidities."

Previous NMAs of first-line mRCC treatments either predate the approval of all the first-line TKIs currently available or do not include evaluation of safety data for all treatments. We performed a systematic literature review and network meta-analysis of phase II/III randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing approved first-line TKI therapies for mRCC. A random effects model with a frequentist approach was computed for progression-free survival (PFS) data and for the proportion of patients experiencing a maximum of grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs). The network meta-analysis of PFS demonstrated no significant differences between cabozantinib and either sunitinib (50\u00a0mg 4/2), pazopanib or tivozanib. The network meta-analysis indicated that in terms of grade 3 and 4 AEs, tivozanib had the most favourable safety profile and was associated with significantly less risk of toxicity than the other TKIs. These network meta-analysis data demonstrate that cabozantinib, sunitinib, pazopanib and tivozanib do not significantly differ in their efficacy, but tivozanib is associated with a more favourable safety profile in terms of grade 3 or 4 toxicities. Consequently, the relative toxicity of these first-line TKIs may play a more significant role than efficacy comparisons in treatment decisions and in planning future RCTs.

        "abstract": "Pain is one of the most important consequences of spinal cord injury (SCI). It may affect several aspects of life, especially the quality of life (QoL). Hence, this study was conducted to establish an understanding of pain and its correlates and effects on patients with SCI in our community. In a cross-sectional study, 58 male veterans suffering from SCI were admitted to our center for a regular follow-up. Demographic and SCI-related descriptive information were gathered using a self-reported questionnaire. To evaluate the patients' pain quality and the effect of pain on daily life, a questionnaire in 3 parts of lumbar, cervical and shoulder pain was administered. EuroQoL questionnaire and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) 12 were also used to assess the patients' QoL. The mean age of the participants was 45.91 \u00b1 6.69 with mean injury time of 25.54 \u00b1 5.91. forty-four patients (75.9%) reported pain, including lumbar pain (63%), cervical pain (39%) and shoulder pain (51%). The presence of pain was associated with lower QoL. Patients with lumbar pain reported a significant amount of pain affecting their daily life and this effect was higher in patients with lower GHQ score or anxiety/depressive disorder. Musculoskeletal pain, is a common complaint in veterans with SCI and is inversely associated with functioning and general health status. Lumbar and shoulder pain affects patient's daily living more than cervical pain."

However, monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids (mmBCFAs) are also present in mammals but thought to be primarily diet-derived. Here we demonstrate that mmBCFAs are de novo synthesized via mitochondrial BCAA catabolism, exported to the cytosol by adipose-specific expression of carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT), and elongated by FASN. Brown fat exhibits the highest BCAA catabolic and mmBCFA synthesis fluxes, whereas these lipids are largely absent from liver and brain. mmBCFA synthesis is also sustained in the absence of microbiota. We identify hypoxia as a potent suppressor of BCAA catabolism that decreases mmBCFA synthesis in obese adipose tissue, such that mmBCFAs are significantly decreased in obese animals. These results identify adipose tissue mmBCFA synthesis as a novel link between BCAA metabolism and lipogenesis, highlighting roles for CrAT and FASN promiscuity that influence acyl-chain diversity in the lipidome."

A descriptive cross-sectional design was used with a convenient sample of 400 CHD patients from three hospitals in Jordan. A modified version of the Smoking Scale for Adults (SS-A) was used. The percentage of SHS exposure was 64% in public places, 51.5% in social places, 48.5% in the household, 31% in transportation, while it was only 14.8% in the workplace. In addition, being male, employed, having a younger age and lower education significantly predicted higher exposure to SHS. Exposure to SHS was positively associated with CHD complications and the number of admissions, while it was negatively associated with the age at diagnosis with CHD. Collaboration is needed among all health care sectors to adopt educational strategies about SHS exposure and to activate policies to prohibit smoking in public places."

        "abstract": "Accurate genome inheritance by daughter cells requires that sister chromatids in the mother attach to microtubules emanating from opposite poles of the mitotic spindle (bi-orientation). A surveillance mechanism named the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) monitors the microtubule attachment process, temporarily halting sister chromatid separation and mitotic exit until completion of bi-orientation 1 . SAC failure results in abnormal chromosome numbers (aneuploidy), a hallmark of many tumours. The HORMA domain protein MAD2 is a subunit of the SAC effector mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC). Structural conversion from open to closed MAD2 is required for MAD2 incorporation in MCC 1 . In vitro , MAD2 conversion and MCC assembly requires several hours 2 \u2013 4 , while the SAC response in cells is established in a few minutes 5 \u2013 7 . To address this discrepancy, we reconstituted with purified components a near-complete SAC signalling system and monitored MCC assembly with real-time sensors. Dramatic acceleration of MAD2 conversion and MCC assembly was observed when MPS1 phosphorylated the MAD1:MAD2 complex, triggering its template function in the MAD2 conversion and contributing to the establishment of a physical platform for MCC assembly. Thus, catalytic activation of the SAC depends on regulated protein-protein interactions that accelerate the spontaneous but rate-limiting conversion of MAD2 required for MCC assembly."

The COVID-19 pandemic had led to an increase in demand for remote care in patients with inflammatory bowel disease who require monitoring and frequent access to health services. A retrospective study of all activity (in person and by phone call or email) done on the unit during the acute phase of the pandemic at a reference hospital in Spain. Numbers of activities done by nurses, reasons for telehealth care and sociodemographic and clinical data were collected. Statistical analysis was performed using frequency, chi-squared and analysis of variance tests. A total of 1095 activities for 561 patients who received care were reported. Among them, 1042 (95.2%) were telemedicine activities, amounting to a 47.3% increase over the prior year. COVID-19-related activities numbered 588 (59.5%). Consultations due to disease flare-up numbered 134 (13.7%), representing a 145% increase compared to 2019. Significant differences were found between reasons for using telemedicine and diagnosis, occupational status, contact week and treatment. The acute phase of the pandemic has changed the activity managed by the nursing staff on the unit. Identifying and analysing these changes has yielded valuable information to achieve more efficient management and better care quality for patients in special situations."

Pancreatitis, panniculitis and polyarthritis syndrome is a very rare manifestation of pancreatitis with panniculitis and polyarthritis with intraosseous fat necrosis. A rare differential diagnosis of unclear polyarthritis, panniculitis or osteonecrosis. Surgical treatment, if possible can lead to complete remission. Pancreatitis, panniculitis and polyarthritis syndrome is a very rare extra-pancreatic complication of pancreatic diseases. While in most cases this syndrome is caused by acute or chronic pancreatitis, we report a case of a 62-year-old man presenting with extensive intraosseous fat necrosis, polyarthritis and panniculitis caused by a post-pancreatitis pseudocyst with a fistula to the superior mesenteric vein and extremely high blood levels of lipase. This became symptomatic 2.5 years after an episode of acute pancreatitis and as in most cases abdominal symptoms were absent. Treatment by surgical resection of the pancreatic head with the pseudocyst and mesenteric fistula led to complete remission of all symptoms. A review of the literature revealed that all publications are limited to case reports. Most authors hypothesize that an unspecific damage can cause a secretion of pancreatic enzymes to the bloodstream leading to a systemic lipolysis and fat tissue necrosis, especially of subcutaneous tissue, bone marrow, inducing panniculitis, polyarthritis and osteonecrosis. Even if caused by an acute pancreatitis abdominal symptoms are often mild or absent in most cases leading to misdiagnosis and poor prognosis. While symptomatic treatment with NSAR and cortisone showed poor to moderate response, causal treatment can be successful depending on the underlying pancreatic disease."

In rural areas of Turkey, females are more exposed to biomass smoke because of traditional lifestyles. The aim of this study was to determine the adverse effects of biomass smoke on pulmonary functions and define the relationship between duration in years and an index (cumulative exposure index) with altered pulmonary function test results. A total of 115 females who lived in the village of Ka\u011fizman (a borough of Kars located in the eastern part of Turkey) and were exposed to biomass smoke were included in the study. The control group was generated with 73 individuals living in the same area who were never exposed to biomass smoke. Twenty-seven (23.8%) females in the study group and four (5.5%) in the control group had small airway disease ( P =0.038). Twenty-two (19.1%) females in the study group and ten (13.7%) in the control group had obstruction ( P =0.223). Twenty (17.3%) females in the study group who were exposed to biomass smoke had restriction compared with ten (13%) in the control group ( P =0.189). The duration needed for the existence of small airway disease was 16 years, for obstructive airway disease was 17 years, and for restrictive airway disease was 17 years. The intensity of biomass smoke was defined in terms of cumulative exposure index; it was calculated by multiplying hours per day, weeks per month, and total years of smoke exposure and dividing the result by three. Exposure to biomass smoke is a serious public health problem, especially in rural areas of developing countries, because of its negative effects on pulmonary functions. As the duration and the intensity of exposure increase, the probability of having altered pulmonary function test results is higher."

The gene is flanked by \u03b2-lactam regulatory genes similar to mecR , mecI , and blaZ and is part of an 84.6-kb multidrug-resistance plasmid that harbors genes encoding additional resistances to aminoglycosides ( aacA-aphD , aphA , and aadK ) as well as macrolides ( ermB ) and tetracyclines ( tetS ). This further plasmidborne \u03b2-lactam resistance mechanism harbors the putative risk of acceleration or reacceleration of MRSA spread, resulting in broad ineffectiveness of \u03b2-lactams as a main therapeutic application against staphylococcal infections."

Here we explored associations between SNPs in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR ) gene or combined genotypes and the risk of ASD in a Saudi community. ASD severity symptoms were assessed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) criteria and scores on the childhood autism rating scale (CARS). Genomic DNA from buccal cells was analyzed for 112 cases and 104 healthy controls using TaqMan genotyping assays of 677C>T rs1801133 and 1298A>C rs1801131 SNPs in the MTHFR gene. SNPStats software was utilized to determine the best interactive model of inheritance of genotypic data. Controls were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the examined SNPs. Our data showed associations between the 677C>T and 1298A>C SNPs and ASD risk (odds ratio [OR]= 5.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1\u20139.8 and OR= 22.2; 95% CI, 7.9\u201362.3, respectively). Genotype associations of 677C>T and 1298A>C were identified in cases compared with controls ( P = 0.0012 and P = 0.0008, respectively). The examined SNPs were significantly associated with ASD cases having \u226537 scores (codominant and recessive models; P = 0.001 and P = 0.0005, respectively). Six combined genotypes\u2014C/C-A/A (42.9%), C/T-A/A (17.9%), C/T-C/C (14.5%), C/T-A/C (10.9%), T/T-C/C (10.9%), and T/T-A/A (3.6%)\u2014were found in ASD cases. Global haplotype analysis showed a significant difference in haplotype distribution between cases and controls ( P = 0.00057). The two SNPs were found to be in relatively strong linkage disequilibrium ( D` = 0.63, r 2 = 0.260). Our findings suggest that the 677C>T and 1298A>C SNPs add to each other for potential vulnerability to increase the risk of ASD, particularly if they can be confirmed in larger cohorts along with other genetic/environmental factors. Our study could create reference data for future genetic association studies in the Saudi population and for use by government and health experts to develop regional health management programs."

The participants consisted of 155 postoperative breast cancer patients (56 breast conserving surgery, 56 mastectomy, and 43 oncoplastic surgery). Subjects were evaluated using the K-BIS, the Body-Esteem Scale for Adolescents and Adults (BESAA), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale Abbreviated Version (WHOQOL-BREF). Test-retest reliability and internal consistency were examined as a measure of reliability and validity was evaluated by convergent validity, discriminant validity and factor analysis. Cronbach's \u03b1 value was 0.943. The total score of the K-BIS was negatively correlated with the BESAA (r=0.301, p<0.001) and the body image facet in the WHOQOL-BREF (r=0.315, p<0.001). The total score of K-BIS positively correlated with the HADS (HAD-A: r=0.501, p<0.001, HAD-D: r=0.466, p<0.001). As for determining discriminant validity, scores were compared between the BCS subgroup, mastectomy subgroup, and oncoplastic surgery subgroup. Difference between the mastectomy subgroup and oncoplastic surgery subgroup was statistically significant (p=0.017). Factor analysis resulted in a single factor solution in three out of four anlyses, accounting for >59% variance. The K-BIS showed good reliability and validity for assessment of body image in Korean breast cancer patients."

The present study was designed to evaluate the protective role of petroleum ether extract of Cissus quadrangularis (PECQ) on diabetes-induced delayed fetal skeletal ossification. Female Wistar rats were rendered diabetic with streptozotocin (STZ, 40 mg/kg, intraperitonial) before mating. After confirmation of pregnancy, the pregnant rats were divided into three groups: normal control group, diabetic control group, and diabetic + CQ group. The diabetic + CQ group pregnant rats were treated with PECQ (500 mg/kg body weight) throughout their gestation period. Immediately after delivery, pups were collected from all three groups and processed for alizarin red S\u2013alcian blue staining in order to examine the pattern of skeletal ossification. Fewer ossification centers and decreased extent of ossification of forelimb and hindlimb bones were observed in the neonatal pups of diabetic control group as compared to those in the normal control group. PECQ pretreatment significantly restored the ossification centers and improved the extent of ossification of forelimb and hindlimb bones in the neonatal pups of diabetic + CQ group as compared to those in the diabetic control group. The results suggested that PECQ treatment is effective against diabetes-induced delayed fetal skeletal ossification. However, further studies on the isolation and characterization of active constituents of PECQ, which can cross the placental barrier and are responsible for the bone anabolic activity are warranted."

The adequate combination of crosslinked hyaluronic acid, coenzyme Q10, and vitamin E TPGS, contained in the ophthalmic solution VisuXL \u00ae , has been shown to protect ocular surface from potential damages originating from prolonged exposure to chlorinated water. VisuXL may represent a compelling treatment in other situations beyond dry eye syndrome."

        "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common psychiatric comorbidities of Internet addiction (IA); however, the possible mechanisms that contribute to this high comorbidity are still under debate. This study aims to analyze these possible mechanisms by comparing the effect of IA severity and childhood ADHD on inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity in young adults with IA. We hypothesized that IA might have associations with ADHD-like cognitive and behavior symptoms aside from childhood ADHD. Study participants consisted of 61 young male adults. Participants were administered a structured interview. The severity of IA, childhood and current ADHD symptoms, and psychiatry comorbid symptoms were assessed through self-rating scales. The associations between the severity of IA and ADHD symptoms were examined through hierarchical regression analyses. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that the severity of IA significantly predicted most dimensions of ADHD symptoms. By contrast, childhood ADHD predicted only one dimension. The high comorbidity of inattention and hyperactivity symptoms in IA should not solely be accounted by an independent ADHD disorder but should consider the possibility of cognitive symptoms related to IA. Functional and structural brain abnormalities associated with excessive and pathologic Internet usage might be related to these ADHD-like symptoms. Inattention and hyperactivity in young adults with IA are more significantly associated with the severity of IA than that of childhood ADHD."

A cross-sectional survey study was conducted in two nursing schools in two countries. A purposive sample of 156 undergraduate nursing students participated in the study. Face and content validity was obtained from an expert panel. The LSS construct was established using principal axis factoring (PAF) with oblimin rotation, a scree plot test, and parallel analysis (PA). The reliability of LSS was tested using Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1, corrected item-total correlation, and test-retest. Factor analysis revealed five components, confirmed by PA and a relatively clear curve on the scree plot. Component strength and interpretability were also confirmed. The factors were labeled as perceptive, solitary, analytic, competitive, and imaginative learning styles. Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 was >0.70 for all subscales in both study populations. The corrected item-total correlations were >0.30 for the items in each component. The LSS is a valid and reliable inventory for evaluating learning style preferences in nursing students in various multicultural environments."

        "abstract": "Cancer cell-derived exosomes have been actively released into the tumor microenvironment with pleiotropic roles in tumor growth and metastasis, including angiogenesis and immune modulation. However, the functions and underlying mechanisms of exosomes shed by colorectal cancer (CRC) cells under hypoxic conditions remain unknown. Here we found that exosomes derived from hypoxic CRC cells promoted the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Suppression of exosome secretion through RAB27a knockdown in CRC cells inhibited exosomal-induced proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Furthermore, we discovered that these exosomes enriched with Wnt4 were dependent on HIF1\u03b1. Exosomal Wnt4 increased \u03b2-catenin nuclear translocation in endothelial cells. The induction of \u03b2-catenin signaling is critical for the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, which could be abolished by the inhibitor ICG001. The in vivo animal study further revealed the tumor-promoting effects of CRC cell-derived exosomes with enhanced tumor growth and angiogenesis. Taken together, our study indicates that CRC cells promote angiogenesis through exosome-mediated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in endothelial cells under hypoxia, which might be a new mechanism in CRC development."

Since October 2020 the second wave of the pandemic has been observed around the world, as pathogen specific herd immunity has not been built yet. Moreover, the current, more contagious pathogen carrying the D614G mutation has become the globally dominant form of SARS-CoV-2. In this article we present the current state of knowledge on the impact of ACE2 and the reninangiotensin system (RAS) and the innate immune system on different outcomes of COVID-19. Especially, we point out the dual role of the immune system and ACE2 in pathogenesis of the disease. Namely, at the initial stage of the infection anti-viral activity of innate immunity is responsible for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication. On the other hand, a dysregulated immune response may cause the detrimental hyperinflammation (\u201ccytokine storm\u201d) responsible for the severe course of the disease. Concomitantly, we analyse the roles of ACE2 in both facilitation of infection and abrogation of its effects, as the major cellular entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and an important enzyme responsible for tissue protection, respectively. Finally, we discuss the dominant impact of aging on the fatal outcome of COVID-19."

We studied the biological effect of the extract by real-time analysis in the xCELLigence system, WST-1 assay and LIVE/DEAD viability assay. We show that the extract significantly perturbed the viability of cancer cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In contrast, non-cancerous McCoy-Plovdiv cells sustained their proliferation potential even at high concentrations of the extract. Therefore, we propose that the active constituents of the Ginkgo biloba endosperm extract may interact additively or synergistically to protect against cancer.

However, it is still controversial whether the combined use of traditional Chinese medicine Xuebijing injections (XBJI) and western medicine can enhance curative efficacy and ensure safety compared with western medicine alone. Thus, this research consisted of a systematic review of the curative efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine XBJI combined with ulinastatin for treating sepsis in the Chinese population. A total of 8 databases were retrieved: 4 foreign databases, namely, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science; and 4 Chinese databases, namely, Sino Med, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP, and Wangfang Data. The time span of retrieval began from the establishment of each database and ended on August 1, 2017. Published randomized controlled trials about the combined use of traditional Chinese medicine XBJI and western medicine were included, regardless of language. Stata12.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Finally, 16 papers involving 1335 cases were included. The result of meta-analysis showed that compared with the single use of ulinastatin, traditional Chinese medicine XBJI combined with ulinastatin could reduce the time of mechanical ventilation, shorten the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, improve the 28-day survival rate, and decrease the occurrence rate of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, case fatality rate, procalcitonin (PCT) content, APACKEII score, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 level, and interleukin (IL)-6 level. On the basis of the common basic therapeutic regimen, the combined use of traditional Chinese medicine XBJI and ulinastatin was compared with the use of ulinastatin alone for treating sepsis in the Chinese population. It was found that the number of adverse events of combination therapy is not significantly increased, and its clinical safety is well within the permitted range. However, considering the limitations of this conclusion due to the low-quality articles included in the present research, it is necessary to conduct high-quality randomized controlled trials."

Ninety-five urine samples and 234 prostate tissue samples from patients with PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were analyzed. Micro-array analysis was used to identify candidate genes, which were verified by the two-gene expression ratio and validated in tissue mRNA and urinary nucleic acid cohorts. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to measure urinary nucleic acid levels and tissue mRNA expression. The TSPAN13 -to- S100A9 ratio was selected to determine the diagnostic value of urinary nucleic acids in PCa ( P = 0.037) and shown to be significantly higher in PCa than in BPH in the mRNA and nucleic acid cohort analyses ( P < 0.001 and P = 0.013, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve was 0.898 and 0.676 in tissue mRNA cohort and urinary nucleic acid cohort, respectively. The TSPAN13 -to- S100A9 ratio showed a strong potential as a diagnostic marker for PCa. The present results suggest that the analysis of urine supernatant can be used as a simple diagnostic method for PCa that can be adapted to the clinical setting in the future."

Data on the novel CoV respiratory disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) in patients with cancer are still limited. Unlike other common viruses, CoVs have not been shown to cause a more severe disease in immunocompromised subjects. Along with direct viral pathogenicity, in some individuals, CoV infection triggers an uncontrolled aberrant inflammatory response, leading to lung tissue damage. In patients with cancer treated with immunotherapy (e.g. immune checkpoint inhibitors), COVID-19 may therefore represent a serious threat. After a thorough review of the literature on CoV pathogenesis and cancer, we selected several shared features to define which patients can be considered at higher risk of COVID-19.

MSM with abnormal cytology should be referred for high-resolution anoscopy and biopsy. Individuals with HGAIN should receive treatment; treatment modalities for HGAIN demonstrate moderate efficacy and are usually well tolerated, but greater study is required to determine which treatment is optimal. Large prospective studies are needed to document the efficacy of screening and treatment of HGAIN on anal cancer incidence.

Thus, inhibition of KIT has been a major focus for treatment of this disorder. Here we investigated a novel approach to such inhibition. Utilizing rational drug design, we targeted the switch pocket (SP) of KIT which regulates its catalytic conformation. Two SP inhibitors thus identified, DP-2976 and DP-4851, were examined for effects on neoplastic mast cell proliferation and mast cell activation. Autophosphorylation of both wild type (WT) and, where also examined, KIT D816V was blocked by these compounds in transfected 293T cells, HMC 1.1 and 1.2 human mast cell lines; and in CD34 + -derived human mast cells activated by stem cell factor (SCF). Both inhibitors induced apoptosis in the neoplastic mast cell lines and reduced survival of primary bone marrow mast cells from patients with mastocytosis. Moreover, the SP inhibitors more selectively blocked SCF potentiation of Fc\u03b5RI-mediated degranulation. Overall, SP inhibitors represent an innovative mechanism of KIT inhibition whose dual suppression of KIT D816V neoplastic mast cell proliferation and SCF enhanced mast cell activation may provide significant therapeutic benefits."

        "abstract": "Pancreatic islet microendothelium exhibits unique features in interdependent relationship with beta cells. Gastrointestinal products of the ghrelin gene, acylated ghrelin (AG), unacylated ghrelin (UAG) and obestatin (Ob), and the incretin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), prevent apoptosis of pancreatic beta cells. We investigated whether the ghrelin gene products and the GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 (Ex-4) display survival effects in human pancreatic islet microendothelial cells (MECs) exposed to chronic hyperglycaemia. Islet MECs were cultured in high glucose concentration and treated with AG, UAG, Ob or Ex-4. Apoptosis was assessed by DNA fragmentation, Hoechst staining of the nuclei and caspase-3 activity. Western blot analyses and pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase B (Akt) and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)1/2 pathways, detection of intracellular cAMP levels and blockade of adenylyl cyclase (AC)/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signalling were performed. Levels of NO, IL-1\u03b2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A in cell culture supernatant fractions were measured. Islet MECs express the ghrelin receptor GHS-R1A as well as GLP-1R. Treatment with AG, UAG, Ob and Ex-4 promoted cell survival and significantly inhibited glucose-induced apoptosis, through activation of PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and intracellular cAMP increase. Moreover, peptides upregulated B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and downregulated BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX) and CD40 ligand (CD40L) production, and significantly reduced the secretion of NO, IL-1\u03b2 and VEGF-A. The ghrelin gene-derived peptides and Ex-4 exert cytoprotective effects in islet MECs. The anti-apoptotic effects involve phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, ERK1/2 and cAMP/PKA pathways. These peptides could therefore represent a potential tool to improve islet vascularisation and, indirectly, islet cell function.

These two types of association learning (preference learning vs. aversion learning) are known as classical conditioned reactions which are basic learning and memory phenomena, leading selection of food and proper food intake. Since the perception of flavor is generated by interaction of taste and odor during food intake, taste and/or odor are mainly associated with bodily signals in the flavor learning. After briefly reviewing flavor learning in general, brain mechanisms of conditioned taste aversion is described in more detail. The CS\u2013US association leading to long-term potentiation in the amygdala, especially in its basolateral nucleus, is the basis of establishment of conditioned taste aversion. The novelty of the CS detected by the cortical gustatory area may be supportive in CS\u2013US association. After the association, CS input is conveyed through the amygdala to different brain regions including the hippocampus for contextual fear formation, to the supramammillary and thalamic paraventricular nuclei for stressful anxiety or memory dependent fearful or stressful emotion, to the reward system to induce aversive expression to the CS, or hedonic shift from positive to negative, and to the CS-responsive neurons in the gustatory system to enhance the responsiveness to facilitate to detect the harmful stimulus."

The contribution of air lead to blood lead according to year of birth was strongest for subjects born in 1987 and fell to nearly zero for children born in 1992. The geometric mean of the entire cohort rose from 8.4 \u03bcg/dL in the first year of life to 10.1 \u03bcg/dL in the second and decreased thereafter until it reached 6.4 \u03bcg/dL at 10 years of age. Children of families who used lead-glazed ceramics had blood lead levels 18.5% higher than did children of nonusing families. Children who belonged to the lowest socioeconomic levels had blood lead levels 32.2% higher than did those of highest socioeconomic levels. Children who lived in the northeast part of the city had blood lead levels 10.9% higher compared with those who lived in the southwest."

This study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of arthroscopic-assisted LD tendon transfer for the management of irreparable rotator cuff tears in active middle-aged patients. The records of five patients (two males) with irreparable tears involving the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons managed by arthroscopic-assisted LD tendon transfer were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scale, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon\u2019s (ASES) scores, the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) scale, and ranges of motion. Postoperative integrities of transferred tendon were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging in 4 patients and by ultrasound in one. Mean patient age was 55 years (range, 48\u201361 years), and mean follow-up period was 20 months (range, 12.0\u201327.2 months). Mean VAS score significantly improved from 6.6 \u00b1 2.6 preoperatively to 1.8 \u00b1 2.5 postoperatively ( p =0.009), mean ASES score increased from 67.6 \u00b1 9.2 to 84.6 \u00b1 15.1, and mean UCLA score from 18.0 \u00b1 1.4 to 28.8 \u00b1 8.5 (all p <0.001). Postoperative imaging of the transferred LD tendon showed intact repair in 4 patients. The remaining patient experienced LD transfer rupture and a poor outcome. Arthroscopic-assisted LD tendon transfer improved shoulder pain and function in patients with massive, irreparable rotator cuff tears, and may be an option for this condition, especially in physically active patients."

        "abstract": "Under-reporting of ADR may be associated with poor knowledge, attitudes and practices to pharmacovigilance. This study evaluated knowledge, attitudes and practices of healthcare professionals about ADR monitoring and reporting following interventions. This longitudinal study included 36 healthcare professionals participating in ART program in a tertiary hospital. Interventions included group training on pharmacovigilance (PV) and provision of ADR reporting forms amongst others. Assessments were conducted at months 0 and 6 post-interventions using study-specific Likert-type instruments. Mean attitude scores above midpoint of 3.6 on 5-point scale were regarded as positive and below as negative. P<0.05 used to determine statistical significance. Mean age of participants was 36.6 (95%CI, 34.5\u201338.7) years; 61.1% males; 44.4% doctors, 13.9% pharmacists, 19.4% nurses, 8.3% laboratory scientists, 8.3% record officers and 5.6% welfare officers. None had received training on PV previously. Mean knowledge test score increased from 53.6% (95%CI, 44.6\u201363.6) at pre-intervention to 77.1% (95%CI, 72.8\u201381.4) at post-intervention with a mean change of 146.9% (95%CI, 60.5\u2013233.3; p=0.000). Mean rated attitude scores increased from 3.6 (95%CI, 3.4\u20133.8) at pre-intervention to 4.2 (95%CI, 4.0\u20134.4) at post-intervention; the difference was statistically significant (p=0.000). 75.8% reported that ADR reporting forms were not readily available at pre-intervention compared to 18.2% at postintervention; 15.2% had reported ADR previously at pre-intervention compared to 69.7% at post-intervention; 12.1% reported providing information regarding ADRs and its management always at pre-intervention compared to 45.5% at post-intervention; these differences were statistically significant (p<0.05). Lack/inadequate knowledge, unavailability of reporting forms and negative attitudes were barriers identified; and addressing them resulted in significant improvement in this setting. Scaling up these interventions to other hospitals can better the situation of under-reporting of ADRs in Nigeria."

        "abstract": "Kidney formation is regulated by the balance between maintenance and differentiation of nephron progenitor cells (NPCs). Now that directed differentiation of NPCs from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be achieved, maintenance and propagation of NPCs in\u00a0vitro should be beneficial for regenerative medicine. Although WNT and FGF signals were previously shown to be essential for NPC propagation, the requirement for BMP/TGF\u03b2 signaling remains controversial. Here we reveal that activin has superior effects to BMP7 on maintenance efficiency of human iPSC-derived NPCs. Activin expanded ITGA8 + /PDGFRA \u2212 /SIX2-GFP + NPCs by 5-fold per week at 80%\u201390% efficiency, and the propagated cells possessed robust capacity for nephron formation both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo . The expanded cells also maintained their nephron-forming potential after freezing. Furthermore, the protocol was applicable to multiple non-GFP-tagged iPSC lines. Thus, our activin-based protocol will be applicable to a variety of research fields including disease modeling and drug screening. \u2022 Nephron progenitors reside in the ITGA8 + /PDGFRA \u2212 /SIX2-GFP + fraction \u2022 Activin is superior to BMP7 for maintaining human iPSC-derived nephron progenitors \u2022 The expanded progenitors robustly form kidney tissues in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo \u2022 The activin-based protocol is applicable to multiple iPSC lines without a GFP tag Nephron progenitors reside in the ITGA8 + /PDGFRA \u2212 /SIX2-GFP + fraction Activin is superior to BMP7 for maintaining human iPSC-derived nephron progenitors The expanded progenitors robustly form kidney tissues in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo The activin-based protocol is applicable to multiple iPSC lines without a GFP tag Nishinakamura and colleagues reveal that activin can maintain human iPSC-derived nephron progenitors with higher efficiency than BMP7.

Of 2032 respondents, 1473 (72.5%) reported that they would be willing to volunteer during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than half of the students reported having a desire to volunteer in non-patient contact activities such as data entry (65.9%) and logistics (57.7%). Whereas less than 50% of the participants were willing to volunteer with activities involving patients. Year of education, study field, educational format, living arrangements, health status self-perception, chronic illness possession, COVID-19 fear level, past volunteering experience in non-healthcare sectors, and COVID-19 prevention and control training course attendance were all associated with a willingness to volunteer. The strongest barriers preventing volunteering included fear for the health of their family and lack of training/knowledge.\u00a0Conclusively, healthcare students reported a high level of willingness, indicating a positive attitude toward responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Adequate training should be employed to increase the willingness among healthcare students in Vietnam."

        "abstract": "Mosquito-borne flaviviruses are a major current and emerging threat, affecting millions of people worldwide. Global climate change, combined with increasing proximity of humans to animals and mosquito vectors by expansion into natural habitats, coupled with the increase in international travel, have resulted in significant spread and concomitant increase in the incidence of infection and severe disease. Although neuroinvasive disease has been well described for some viral infections such as Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) and West Nile virus (WNV), others such as dengue virus (DENV) have recently displayed an emerging pattern of neuroinvasive disease, distinct from the previously observed, systemically-induced encephalomyelopathy. In this setting, the immune response is a crucial component of host defence, in preventing viral dissemination and invasion of the central nervous system (CNS). However, subversion of the anti-viral activities of macrophages by flaviviruses can facilitate viral replication and spread, enhancing the intensity of immune responses, leading to severe immune-mediated disease which may be further exacerbated during the subsequent infection with some flaviviruses. Furthermore, in the CNS myeloid cells may be responsible for inducing specific inflammatory changes, which can lead to significant pathological damage during encephalitis. The interaction of virus and cells of the myeloid lineage is complex, and this interaction is likely responsible at least in part, for crucial differences between viral clearance and pathology. Recent studies on the role of myeloid cells in innate immunity and viral control, and the mechanisms of evasion and subversion used by flaviviruses are rapidly advancing our understanding of the immunopathological mechanisms involved in flavivirus encephalitis and will lead to the development of therapeutic strategies previously not considered."

Molecular methods have the potency to provide accurate and rapid drug susceptibility results. We aimed to establish and evaluate the accuracy of a reverse dot blot hybridization (RDBH) assay to simultaneously detect the resistance of fluoroquinolones (FQs), kanamycin (KN), amikacin (AMK), capreomycin (CPM) and second-line injectable drugs (SLIDs) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis . We established and evaluated the accuracy of the RDBH assay by comparing to the phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) and sequencing in 170 M. tuberculosis , of which 94 and 27 were respectively resistant to ofloxacin (OFX) and SLIDs. The results show that, compared to phenotypic DST, the sensitivity and specificity of the RDBH assay for resistance detection were 63.8% and 100.0% for OFX, 60.0% and 100.0% for KN, 61.5% and 98.1% for AMK, 50.0% and 99.3% for CPM, and 55.6% and 100% for SLIDs, respectively; compared to sequencing, the sensitivity and specificity of the RDBH assay were 95.2% and 100.0% for OFX, 93.8% and 100.0% for SLIDs or KN (both based on mutations in rrs 1400 region and eis promoter), and 91.6% and 100.0% for AMK or CPM (both based on mutations in rrs 1400 region), respectively. The turnaround time of the RDBH assay was 7 h for testing 42 samples. Our data suggested that compared to sequencing, the RDBH assay could serve as a rapid and reliable method for testing the resistance of M. tuberculosis against OFX and SLIDs, enabling early administration of appropriate treatment regimens among MDR tuberculosis patients."

SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and its severity highly variable. The fatality rate is unpredictable but is amplified by several factors including advancing age, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity. A large proportion of patients with these conditions are treated with lipid lowering medication and questions regarding the safety of continuing lipid-lowering medication in patients infected with COVID-19 have arisen. Some have suggested they may exacerbate their condition. It is important to consider known interactions with lipid-lowering agents and with specific therapies for COVID-19. This statement aims to collate current evidence surrounding the safety of lipid-lowering medications in patients who have COVID-19. We offer a consensus view based on current knowledge and we rated the strength and level of evidence for these recommendations. Pubmed, Google scholar and Web of Science were searched extensively for articles using search terms: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, coronavirus, Lipids, Statin, Fibrates, Ezetimibe, PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies, nicotinic acid, bile acid sequestrants, nutraceuticals, red yeast rice, Omega-3-Fatty acids, Lomitapide, hypercholesterolaemia, dyslipidaemia and Volanesorsen. There is no evidence currently that lipid lowering therapy is unsafe in patients with COVID-19 infection. Lipid-lowering therapy should not be interrupted because of the pandemic or in patients at increased risk of COVID-19 infection. In patients with confirmed COVID-19, care should be taken to avoid drug interactions, between lipid-lowering medications and drugs that may be used to treat COVID-19, especially in patients with abnormalities in liver function tests.

To this end, their impact on plasma biomarkers of kidney function, as well as renal lipid profile, biomarkers of oxidative stress, electrolyte profile and activities of renal ATPases was monitored in doxorubicin treated rats. Metformin (250\u200amg/kg body weight, orally) and the extracts (50, 75 and 100\u200amg/kg, orally) were daily administered for 14\u200adays; while nephrotoxicity was induced with doxorubicin (15\u200amg/kg, intra-peritioneally), once on the 12th day of study. The plasma concentrations of creatinine, and urea; as well as the renal malondialdehyde, cholesterol, calcium and sodium concentrations in the Test control, were significantly ( P <\u200a.05) higher than those of all the other groups.

In China, the current states of medical education and healthcare workplaces differ in certain areas from those in Western or other Asian countries. However, the mental health status of Chinese medical students has not been systematically analyzed. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to summarize the prevalence of mental health problems in Chinese medical students. All cross-sectional studies that investigated the prevalence of any mental health problem among Chinese medical students were retrieved from the following databases: EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, OVID, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We accepted each individual trial's inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants. The National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies was adopted to appraise the methodological quality of each study. RevMan (version 5.3) was used to analyze the data. Ten cross-sectional studies involving a total of 30,817 Chinese medical students were included. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and eating disorders were 29%, 21%, 11%, and 2%, respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed no significant differences in the prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation between genders and no significant difference in the prevalence of depression between individuals of different ages (20 years and older or younger than 20 years). Chinese medical students have relatively high prevalence of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation but a low prevalence of eating disorders. Mental health problems in Chinese medical students should be taken seriously, and timely screening of and proper intervention in these mental health problems are highly recommended."

        "abstract": "Chronic tissue injury with fibrosis results in the disruption of tissue architecture, organ dysfunction, and eventual organ failure. Therefore, the development of effective antifibrotic drugs is urgently required. IMB-S7 is novel biphenyl compound derived from bifendate (biphenyldicarboxylate) that is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis in China. In the current study we investigated the potential of IMB-S7 as an antihepatic fibrosis agent. In bile duct ligation (BDL) rat model, oral administration of IMB-S7 (400\u2009mg\u00b7\u2009kg \u22121 \u00b7\u2009d \u22121 , for 14 days) significantly ameliorated BDL-induced liver necrosis, bile duct proliferation, and collagen accumulation. We then showed that IMB-S7 treatment markedly suppressed the TGF-\u03b2/Smad pathway in human hepatic stellate cell line LX2 and mouse primary HSCs, as well as in liver samples of BDL rats, thus inhibiting the transcription of most fibrogenesis-associated genes, including TGF-\u03b21 , COL1A1 , and ACTA2 . Furthermore, IMB-S7 treatment significantly suppressed the expression of integrin \u03b1v at the mRNA and protein levels in TGF-\u03b2-treated LX2 cells and liver samples of BDL rats. Using integrin \u03b1v overexpression and silencing, we demonstrated that integrin \u03b1v activity correlated positively with the activation of TGF-\u03b2/Smad pathway. Based on dual luciferase assay and DNA affinity precipitation assay, we revealed that IMB-S7 inactivated integrin \u03b1v through competitively inhibiting the binding of Sp1, a transcription factor, to the integrin \u03b1v (ITGAV ) promoter (\u2212173/\u2212163 bp). These results suggest that IMB-S7 inhibits HSCs activation and liver fibrosis through Sp1-integrin \u03b1v signaling, and IMB-S7 may be a promising candidate to combat hepatic fibrosis in the future."

        "abstract": "Daehwangmokdantang (DHMDT) is a traditional polyherbal formulation that has known antidiarrheal and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the underlying mechanisms of these activities are poorly understood. In the present study, the inhibitory effects of DHMDT on the production of proinflammatory mediators and cytokines in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages were investigated. The inhibitory effects of DHMDT on LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin (PG)E 2 , tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 production were examined using Griess reagent and ELISA detection kits. The effects of DHMDT on the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, and their upstream signal proteins, including nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and RAC-\u03b1 serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt), a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) downstream effector, were investigated using western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. The results revealed the pretreatment with DHMDT significantly inhibited the LPS-induced production of NO, PGE 2 , TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2, and expression of iNOS, COX-2 TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2, without any significant cytotoxicity. DHMDT also efficiently prevented the translocation of the NF-\u03baB subunit p65 into the nucleus by interrupting the activation of the upstream mediator inhibitor of NF-\u03baB kinase \u03b1/\u03b2. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory effects of DHMDT were associated with the suppression of LPS-induced phosphorylation of Akt and MAPKs in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Therefore, the results of the present study indicate that DHMDT exhibited anti-inflammatory activity via the inhibition of proinflammatory mediators and cytokines, in which the inactivation of NF-\u03baB, PI3K/Akt, and MAPKs may be involved. These results suggest that DHMDT may be a potential anti-inflammatory drug candidate."

The present study sought to determine safety, immunogenicity and cross-species efficacy of Plasmodium falciparum serine repeat antigen 5 polypeptide co-expressed with epitopes of Bacille-Calmette Guerin (BCG), tetanus toxoid (TT) and a chemokine gene. Olive baboons and BALB/c mice were randomly assigned into vaccine and control groups. The vaccine group animals were primed and boosted twice with pIRES plasmids encoding the SERA5+ BCG+ TT alone, or with either CCL5 or CCL20 and the control group with pIRES plasmid vector backbone. Mice and baboons were challenged with P. berghei ANKA and P. knowlesi H strain parasites, respectively. Safety was determined by observing for injection sites reactogenicities, hematology and clinical chemistry. Parasitaemia and survivorship profiles were used to determine cross-species efficacy, and T cell phenotypes, Th1-, Th2-type, T-regulatory immune responses and antibody responses were assessed to determine vaccine immunogenicity. The pSeBCGTT plasmid DNA vaccines were safe and induced Th1-, Th2-type, and T-regulatory responses vaccinated animals showed enhanced CD4 + ( P <0.01), CD 8 + T cells ( P <0.001) activation and IgG anti-SE36 antibodies responses ( P <0.001) at week 4 and 8 post vaccination compared to the control group. Vaccinated mice had a 31.45-68.69% cumulative parasite load reduction and 60% suppression in baboons ( P <0.05) and enhanced survivorship ( P <0.001) with no clinical signs of malaria compared to the control group. The results showed that the vaccines were safe, immunogenic and conferred partial cross-species protection."

Plasmablastic myeloma is an aggressive plasma cell neoplasm associated with poor outcomes. A small number of cases with gastrointestinal involvement is reported in the literature and therefore high index of suspicion is essential for avoiding delays in diagnosis and treatment. Our aim is to present our experience of a 70-year-old patient with a secondary presentation of plasmablastic myeloma manifesting as unstable upper gastrointestinal bleeding and to review the literature with the view to consolidate and discuss information about diagnosis and management of this rare entity. In addition to our case, a literature search (PubMed database) of case reports of extramedullary plasma cell neoplasms manifesting as upper gastrointestinal bleeding was performed. Twenty-seven cases of extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) involving the stomach and small bowel presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding were retrieved. The majority of patients were males (67%). The average age on diagnosis was 62.7 years. The most common site of presentation was the stomach (41%), followed by the duodenum (15%). The most common presenting complaint was melena (44%). In the majority of cases, the EMPs were a secondary manifestation (63%) at the background of multiple myeloma (26%), plasmablastic myeloma (7%) or high-grade plasma cell myeloma (4%). Oesophagogastroscopy was the main diagnostic modality and chemotherapy the preferred treatment option for secondary EMPs. Despite their rare presentation, upper gastrointestinal EMPs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding especially in the presence of systemic haematological malignancy."

The primary aim of this study was to make a reappraisal of histopathologic features, recurrence and progression. The records of cases consecutively diagnosed with UC in the state hospital pathology laboratory were collected. Cases were classified according to age, gender, histologic grade, pathologic staging [primary Tumor (pT)],tumor configuration, primary or recurrent status, and progression. A total of 35 (29 male and 6 female) cases were examined. The mean age was 68.9 years with a male-to-female incidence ratio of 4.8:1. Low-grade UCs accounted for 20 (57.1%) and high-grade for 15 (42.9%). A papillary pattern was observed in 80% of the UCs, classified into the following pathological stages: 11 (31.4%) pTa, 22 (62.9%) pT1, and 2 (5.9%) pT2 cases. Eleven patients progressed to a higher stage (pT1 to pT2), and three cases from low to higher grade. We analyzed results for 26 (74.3%) cases aged 65 years or older. UCs have a great tendency for recurrence but potentially may be amenable to effective local or systemic treatments."

        "abstract": "The population residing Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) continues to suffer from communicable health problems such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and various neglected tropical as well as non-communicable diseases. The disease burden is aggravated by shortage of medical personnel and medical supplies such as medical devices and minimal access to essential medicine. For long time, human beings through observation and practical experiences learned to use different plant species that led to the emergence of traditional medicine (TM) systems. The ancient Pharaonic Egyptian TM system is one of the oldest documented forms of TM practice in Africa and the pioneer of world\u2019s medical science. However, the medical practices diffused very fast to other continents being accelerated by advancement of technologies while leaving Africa lagging behind in the integration of the practice in formal health-care system. Challenging issues that drag back integration is the development of education curricula for training TM experts as the way of disseminating the traditional medical knowledge and practices imbedded in African culture. The few African countries such as Ghana managed to integrate TM products in the National Essential Medicine List while South Africa, Sierra Leone, and Tanzania have TM products being sold over the counters due to the availability of education training programs facilitated by research. This paper analyses the contribution of TM practice and products in modern medicine and gives recommendations that Africa should take in the integration process to safeguard the SSA population from disease burdens."

Recent molecular data support a rostrocaudal subdivision into rostral (terminal) and caudal (peduncular) halves. In this context, the distribution of neuronal populations expressing somatostatin ( Sst ) mRNA was analyzed in the developing mouse hypothalamus, comparing with the expression pattern of the genes Orthopedia ( Otp ), Distal-less 5 ( Dlx5 ), Sonic Hedgehog ( Shh ), and Nk2 homeobox 1 ( Nkx2.1 ). At embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5), Sst mRNA was first detectable in the anterobasal nucleus, a Nkx2.1 -, Shh -, and Otp- positive basal domain. By E13.5, nascent Sst expression was also related to two additional Otp -positive domains within the alar plate and one in the basal plate. In the alar plate, Sst -positive cells were observed in rostral and caudal ventral subdomains of the Otp -positive paraventricular complex. An additional basal Sst- expressing cell group was found within a longitudinal Otp -positive periretromamillary band that separates the retromamillary area from tuberal areas. Apart of subsequent growth of these initial populations, at E13.5 and E15.5 some Sst -positive derivatives migrate tangentially into neighboring regions. A subset of cells produced at the anterobasal nucleus disperses ventralward into the shell of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus and the arcuate nucleus. Cells from the rostroventral paraventricular subdomain reach the suboptic nucleus, whereas a caudal contingent migrates radially into lateral paraventricular, perifornical, and entopeduncular nuclei. Our data provide a topologic map of molecularly defined progenitor areas originating a specific neuron type during early hypothalamic development. Identification of four main separate sources helps to understand causally its complex adult organization."

Changes to glial connexin 43 levels and neuroinflammation may trigger brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases. To illustrate the relationship between connexin 43 and neuroinflammation, this study investigated how connexin 43 expression levels change in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated rat C6 glioma cells. C6 cells were treated with 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5 and 5 \u03bcg/mL lipopolysaccharide for 24 hours. The nitrite estimation-detected nitric oxide release level was elevated substantially after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. To test the transcriptional level changes of inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and connexin 43 mRNA, C6 cells were treated with 5 \u03bcg/mL lipopolysaccharide for 3\u201348 hours. Reverse transcription-PCR showed that the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 mRNA increased over time, but connexin 43 mRNA levels increased in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated C6 cells at 3 and 6 hours, and then decreased from 12 to 48 hours. Connexin 43 protein expression was detected by immunofluorescence staining, and the protein levels matched the mRNA expression levels. These results suggest that connexin 43 expression is biphasic in lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation in C6 cells, which may be correlated with the connexin 43 compensatory mechanism."

Subject\u2010specific structural gray and white matter network properties (normalized path length, clustering, and small\u2010worldness) were reconstructed. Group differences and differences between those with higher and lower seizure burden (<4 vs.\u00a0\u22654 average monthly seizures in the last year) in network parameters were evaluated. Additionally, correlations between network properties and disease\u2010related variables were calculated. All patients with hippocampal sclerosis as one group did not have altered gray or white matter network properties (all p >\u00a0.05). Patients with lower seizure burden had significantly lower gray matter small\u2010worldness and normalized clustering compared to controls and those with higher seizure burden (all p <\u00a0.04). A higher number of monthly seizures was significantly associated with increased gray and white matter small\u2010worldness, indicating a more rigid network. Overall, there were no differences in network properties in this group of patients with hippocampal sclerosis. However, patients with lower seizure burden had significantly lower gray matter network indices, indicating a more random organization. The correlation between higher monthly seizures and a more rigid network is driven by those with higher seizure burden, who presented a more rigid network compared to those with a lower seizure burden. Temporal lobe epilepsy secondary to hippocampal sclerosis is related to abnormal epileptogenic networks, including multiple temporal and extra\u2010temporal structures, rather than a single focal epileptogenic source. This study aims to assess alterations within structural gray and white matter networks in patients with hippocampal sclerosis, through a graph theory analysis. In patients with hippocampal sclerosis, a more rigidly organized network (higher small\u2010worldness) was related to having more monthly seizures; also, patients with low seizure burden had significantly lower gray matter small\u2010worldness and normalized clustering compared to controls and those with high seizure burden.

All participants, regardless of condition (Controls vs. ADHD without medications vs. ADHD with medications), displayed EIH accompanied by an increase in blood lactate, heart rate, and perceived exertion for the duration of the exercise bout.

Eyes had mild to advanced glaucoma (predominantly primary open-angle, appositional angle-closure, or pseudoexfoliative glaucoma) or OHT and cataract requiring surgery. Effectiveness measures included intraocular pressure (IOP); medication burden; and proportions of eyes with no medications, \u22652 medications, stable or decreased medications vs preoperative, and IOP \u226418 mmHg. Safety measures included visual acuity, cup-to-disc ratio (CDR), visual field (VF), complications, adverse events, and secondary surgical interventions. Patients have been followed for 12 months, and follow-up is ongoing. Of the 290 total eyes that underwent surgery, 165 eyes had 12-month outcomes at the time of data collection and are included in this report. In these eyes, mean Month 12 IOP reduced by 23.2% from 18.27\u00b15.41 mmHg preoperatively to 14.04\u00b12.98 mmHg ( P <0.001), with 95.8% of eyes achieving Month 12 IOP of \u226418 mmHg vs 60.6% preoperatively. Mean number of medications at 12 months decreased by 71.5%, 0.47\u00b10.95 vs 1.65\u00b11.28 preoperatively; 76.4% of eyes were on zero medications vs 17.6% preoperatively ( P <0.001); 14.5% of eyes were on \u22652 medications vs 46.7% preoperatively ( P <0.001); and 98.2% of eyes maintained or reduced medications vs their preoperative regimen. Favorable safety included no stent-related intraoperative complications; limited and transient postoperative adverse events; and stable CDR, VF, and visual acuity. Three eyes with more advanced disease underwent additional glaucoma surgeries. iStent inject implantation with cataract surgery significantly and safely reduced medications and IOP in eyes with various types and severities of glaucoma within a multicenter, multi-provider, real-life setting."

In addition, we reported that radiotherapy-resistant (RT-R) breast cancer cells promote invasion and tumor growth through the activation of P2Y 2 R by ATP released from RT-R-breast cancer cells than breast cancer cells. Moreover, increased numbers of cancer stem cells (CSCs) were observed among the RT-R-breast cancer cell population. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the expression level of five CSC markers (CD24, CD44, Oct3/4, Notch-4 and ALDH1A1) as well as P2Y 2 R in the tumor tissues of patients with breast cancer and determined which CSC marker correlates with P2Y 2 R in breast cancer. According to the immunohistochemical analysis, CD44, Oct3/4 and Notch-4 but not ALDH1A1 were significantly expressed in the tumor tissues (n=180) compared with the normal epithelial tissues (n=20) of patients with breast cancer. It was demonstrated that P2Y 2 R expression was increased in tumor tissues of patients with breast cancer compared with normal epithelial tissue. Notably, it was identified that P2Y 2 R expression has a significant correlation with only the CSC marker Notch-4 in patients with breast cancer. The results of this study suggested for the first time to the best of our knowledge that Notch-4 has a notable correlation with P2Y 2 R, which has important roles in tumor progression and metastasis."

        "abstract": "According to the traditional beliefs of certain cultures, Lawsonia inermis has been reported to cause the abortion or termination of an undesirable pregnancy. The present study was undertaken with the goal of studying the effect of Lawsonia inermis extract on abortion in pregnant BALB/c mice in 2013 in Shahrekord, Iran. This research study used an experimental methodology and was conducted in 2013 in Shahrekord, Iran. Forty female BALB/c mice (30\u201340 gm, 8\u201312 weeks old) were randomly assigned to 4 groups. One male mouse was included for each two female mice (1:2) and they were maintained in a protective cage habitat. Pregnancy of the mice was confirmed by means of a vaginal smear. The doses of 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of the hydroalcoholic extract of Lawsonia inermis were injected intraperitoneally into pregnant mice beginning on the first day and continuing through the seventh day of pregnancy. The control group did not receive any treatment, but was left completely unadministered. On the eighteenth day of pregnancy, the uterine tubes of mice were removed. The subsequent embryonic absorption is considered to be an abortion. The data were analyzed using SPSS software version 22 using Fisher\u2019s exact test and the Kruskal-Wallis H tests. Abortions were observed more often in the experimental groups (p< 0.01). The mean of the serum estrogen level was significantly higher in the case control groups (p< 0.01) and the mean of progesterone level was also significantly lower in the experimental groups (p< 0.01). The use of Lawsonia inermis during pregnancy may cause abortion and therefore it should be considered as contraindication or use with caution."

        "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths. In recent years some essential factors for resolution were identified, but the clinical trials still lack the effective methods to treat or monitor the disease progression. Regenerating islet-derived 3\u03b1 (REG3A) is a member of REG protein family. Previous studies have investigated the altered expression of REG3A in various cancers. In this investigtion we aimed at the biological function and the underlying molecular mechanism of REG3A in GC. We found that REG3A was significantly downregulated in GC and closely related with patient prognoses. REG3A overexpression suppressed the invasion and proliferation promoting apoptosis of GC cells. While REG3A knockdown promoted the invasion, and proliferation suppressing apoptosis of GC cells. It was further found that REG3A performed its biological functions mainly through phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt-GSK3\u03b2 signaling pathway axis. REG3A may be a promising therapeutic strategy for GC."

        "abstract": "Alterations in brain rheology are increasingly recognized as a diagnostic marker for various neurological conditions. Magnetic resonance elastography now allows us to assess brain rheology repeatably, reproducibly, and non-invasively in vivo. Recent elastography studies suggest that brain stiffness decreases one percent per year during normal aging, and is significantly reduced in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and multiple sclerosis. While existing studies successfully compare brain stiffnesses across different populations, they fail to provide insight into changes within the same brain. Here we characterize rheological alterations in one and the same brain under extreme metabolic changes: alive and dead. Strikingly, the storage and loss moduli of the cerebrum increased by 26% and 60% within only three minutes post mortem and continued to increase by 40% and 103% within 45 minutes. Immediate post mortem stiffening displayed pronounced regional variations; it was largest in the corpus callosum and smallest in the brainstem. We postulate that post mortem stiffening is a manifestation of alterations in polarization, oxidation, perfusion, and metabolism immediately after death. Our results suggest that the stiffness of our brain\u2013unlike any other organ\u2013is a dynamic property that is highly sensitive to the metabolic environment Our findings emphasize the importance of characterizing brain tissue in vivo and question the relevance of ex vivo brain tissue testing as a whole. Knowing the true stiffness of the living brain has important consequences in diagnosing neurological conditions, planning neurosurgical procedures, and modeling the brain\u2019s response to high impact loading."

This hypothesis was tested among the long-term uninsured population in South Carolina (SC). This study used data from an in-person survey conducted from May 2014 to January 2015. Interviews were held with the long-term uninsured individuals at multiple sites throughout the state, using a multistage sampling method. SC residents aged 18 to 64 years who had had no health insurance for at least 24 consecutive months were eligible for the survey. The dependent variable is the participants\u2019 attempt to obtain insurance coverage. Key independent variables are self-reported health status, hospitalization in the past year, use of emergency department in the past year, and presence of serious long-standing health problems. The analysis is stratified by the awareness of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)\u2019s individual mandate while controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and household income. Participants\u2019 self-reported health status was not significantly associated with the attempt to sign up for health insurance in both groups (those aware and those unaware of the individual mandate). Being hospitalized in the previous year was significantly associated with their attempt to sign up for insurance in both groups. Participants with serious long-term health problems were more likely to have attempted to sign up for insurance among those who were not aware of the ACA. However, this association was statistically insignificant among those who had heard of ACA. Sicker people were more likely to attempt to sign up for insurance. However, being aware of the ACA\u2019s individual mandate seemed to play a role in reducing adverse selection."

To assess airway inflammation in patients during the course of AECOPD by serial analyses of their exhaled breath condensates (EBC). Twenty-six patients with AECOPD (22 males, mean[SD] percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) 44.8 [14.3]), 11 with stable COPD, and 14 age and sex-matched healthy controls were studied. Patients with AECOPD were treated with systemic steroid and antibiotic for 7 days. EBC was collected from each patient with AECOPD on Day 5, 14, 30, and 60 post-hospitalization using EcoScreen (VIASYS Healthcare, USA) during tidal breathing over 10 minutes. Concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The median (IQR) of TNF-\u03b1 level on Day 5 was 5.08 (3.80\u20136.32) pg/ml, which was lower than on Day 14 (5.84 [4.91\u20139.14] pg/ml, p = 0.017), Day 30 (6.14 [3.82\u20137.67] pg/ml, p = 0.045), and Day 60 (5.60 [4.53\u20138.80] pg/ml, p = 0.009). On Day 60, subjects receiving inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) had a lower level of TNF-\u03b1 than those who were not (4.82 [4.06\u20135.65] vs 7.66 [5.48\u201310.9] pg/ml, p = 0.02). EBC LTB4 level did not change significantly during recovery from AECOPD whereas IL-8 was mostly undetectable. EBC TNF-\u03b1 level was low in patients receiving systemic steroid and antibiotic therapy for AECOPD. These findings suggest a potential role for serial EBC TNF-\u03b1 for non-invasive monitoring of disease activity."

An online survey of 805 medical students and 1900 non-medical students was conducted from Feb 4, 2020 to Feb 7, 2020, in China. The questionnaire measured the subjective estimated severity of COVID-19, the impact of the outbreak, and the levels of anxiety and depression of both medical and non-medical students. Medical students estimated COVID-19 to be more serious and disastrous than non-medical students, while they scored lower than non-medical students on the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and less severe anxiety and depression than non-medical students. The students experienced greater impact from the outbreak and a higher rate of anxiety and depression with increased time focusing on the outbreak. The difference in psychological effects between medical and non-medical students was further enlarged when focusing time was prolonged. The immediate psychological effects of COVID-19 on medical and non-medical students exhibit different characteristics. The outcome of this study provides implication that providing accurate and transparent information about the epidemic and appropriate COVID-19-based knowledge in accessible ways will contribute to the public's mental health during the outbreak."

There is, therefore, a greater need for the understanding of the antibiotic dosage and pharmacokinetics in these patients, to provide them with optimal therapy. PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar. PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar databases were searched using a combination of key words: dialysis, end stage renal disease, renal failure, sustained low efficiency dialysis, extended daily dialysis, prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy (PIRRT), and antibiotic dosing. Studies that investigated antibiotic dosing and pharmacokinetics during SLED/extended daily dialysis/PIRRT were selected for this review. Eleven studies met inclusion criteria and selected for data extraction. The data with regard to dialysis specifications, type of antibiotic including dosages, drug clearances, and dosage recommendations are summarized in Table 1. It is a challenge to find therapeutic doses for antibiotics during SLED therapy because, in general, only aminoglycosides and vancomycin can be assayed in clinical laboratories. Although current studies on antibiotic dosing in SLED are limited due to diverse and undersized patient populations, antibiotic dosage adjustments for patients receiving SLED discussed here will serve as a valuable guide. Future large-scale research should focus on establishing guidelines for antibiotic dosage in SLED. Pharmacokinetic principles should be taken into consideration for the appropriate dosing of drugs during SLED, yet it is vital to monitor response to drug to make sure therapeutic goals are achieved. Antibiotic dosing and timing relative to the initiation of SLED may be important to maximize either the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (time-dependent) or the peak to MIC ratio (concentration-dependent), balancing efficacy and toxicity concerns. Critical care physicians should liaise with nephrologists to make decisions regarding appropriate antibiotic dosing in patients undergoing SLED."

To overcome this problem, we design a three-step delivery strategy based on streptavidin\u2013biotin interaction with the help of c(RGDfK), magnetic fields and lasers. The ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (USIONPs) modified with c(RGDfK) and biotin are delivered at step 1, followed by streptavidin and the doxorubicin (Dox) loaded nanosystems conjugated with biotin at steps 2 and 3, respectively. The delivery systems were proved to be efficient on A549\u00a0cells. The co-localization of signal for each step revealed the targeting mechanism. The external magnetic field could further amplify the endocytosis of USPIONs based on c(RGDfK), and magnify the uptake distinctions among different test groups. Based on photoacoustic imaging, laser-heating treatment could enhance the permeability of tumor venous blood vessels and change the insufficient blood flow in cancer. Then, it was noticed in\u00a0vivo that only three-step delivery with laser-heating and magnetic fields realized the highest tumor distribution of nanosystem. Finally, the magnetism/laser-auxiliary cascaded delivery exhibited the best antitumor efficacy. Generally, this study demonstrated the necessity of combining physical, biological and chemical means of targeting. A new three-step strategy in magnetism/laser-auxiliary is illustrated. Firstly, the tumor is irradiated by 808\u00a0nm laser. Then, USPIONs modified with c(RGDfK)/biotin are injected and magnetic field is applied to the tumor, followed by injection of streptavidin and lipid nanosystems loaded Dox, modified with biotin.

At pre-assessment, the nursing students had a negative attitude on all dimensions of ASMI except benevolence, and positive attitude on all the six domains of ATP. At post-assessment, attitude improved significantly on pessimistic prediction dimension of ASMI, and they were able to maintain their positive attitude on ATP. One-month posting had a weak positive impact on attitude towards mental illness and no detrimental impact on attitude towards psychiatry.

Method : Retrospective review by a consultant in rehabilitation medicine of electronic and case note records of EPIOC recipients with RDs attending a specialist wheelchair service between June 2007 and September 2008. Data were systematically extracted, entered into a database and analysed under three themes; demographic, diagnostic/clinical (including comorbidity and associated clinical features (ACFs) of the illness/disability) and wheelchair factors. Results : Fifty-four (27 male) EPIOC users, mean age 37.3 (SD 18.6, range 11\u201370) with RDs were identified and reviewed a mean of 64 (range 0\u2013131) months after receiving their wheelchair. Diagnoses included 27 types of RDs including Friedreich\u2019s ataxia, motor neurone disease, osteogenesis imperfecta, arthrogryposis, cerebellar syndromes and others. Nineteen users had between them 36 comorbidities and 30 users had 44 ACFs likely to influence the prescription. Tilt-in-space was provided to 34 (63%) users and specialised seating to 17 (31%). Four users had between them complex control or interfacing issues. Conclusions : The complex and diverse clinical problems of those with RDs present unique challenges to the multiprofessional wheelchair team to maintain successful independent mobility and community living. Implications for Rehabilitation Powered mobility is a major therapeutic tool for those with rare diseases enhancing independence, participation, reducing pain and other clinical features. The challenge for rehabilitation professionals is reconciling the physical disabilities with the individual\u2019s need for function and participation whilst allowing for disease progression and/or growth. Powered wheelchair users with rare diseases with a (kypho) scoliosis require a wheelchair system that balances spine stability and movement to maximise residual upper limb and trunk function. The role of specialised seating needs careful consideration in supporting joint derangements and preventing complications such as pressure sores.

        "abstract": "This systematic review, stimulated by inconsistency in secondary evidence, reports the benefits and harms of breast cancer (BC) screening and their determinants according to systematic reviews. A systematic search, which identified 9,976 abstracts, led to the inclusion of 58 reviews. BC mortality reduction with screening mammography was 15\u201325% in trials and 28\u201356% in observational studies in all age groups, and the risk of stage III+ cancers was reduced for women older than 49\u2009years. Overdiagnosis due to mammography was 1\u201360% in trials and 1\u201312% in studies with a low risk of bias, and cumulative false\u2010positive rates were lower with biennial than annual screening (3\u201317% vs 0.01\u201341%). There is no consistency in the reviews\u2019 conclusions about the magnitude of BC mortality reduction among women younger than 50\u2009years or older than 69\u2009years, or determinants of benefits and harms of mammography, including the type of mammography (digital vs screen\u2010film), the number of views and the screening interval. Similarly, there was no solid evidence on determinants of benefits and harms or BC mortality reduction with screening by ultrasonography or clinical breast examination (sensitivity ranges, 54\u201384% and 47\u201369%, respectively), and strong evidence of unfavourable benefit\u2010to\u2010harm ratio with breast self\u2010examination. The reviews\u2019 conclusions were not dependent on the quality of the reviews or publication date. Systematic reviews on mammography screening, mainly from high\u2010income countries, systematically disagree on the interpretation of the benefit\u2010to\u2010harm ratio. Future reviews are unlikely to clarify the discrepancies unless new original studies are published.  What's new?  Multiple reviews of the benefits and harms of mammography have been used to inform breast cancer screening guideline development. This process, however, has led to inconsistent screening recommendations. Here, synthesis of results from systematic reviews based on original evidence of determinants of mammography benefits and harms reveals irregularities in data on magnitude of breast cancer reduction obtained with screening mammography. Evidence on determinants of benefits and harms of ultrasonography and clinical breast examination was lacking. Inconsistency in reviews' conclusions was affected by characteristics of the original evidence, indicating that new original studies are needed to clarify discrepancies in screening recommendations."

        "abstract": "Emerging studies have indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in skeletal muscle growth and development. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to understand the function and regulatory mechanisms of these lncRNAs in muscle biology and associated diseases. Here, we identify a novel lncRNA, Mir22hg , that is significantly upregulated during myoblast differentiation and is highly expressed in skeletal muscle. We validated that Mir22hg promotes myoblast differentiation in\u00a0vitro . Mechanistically, Mir22hg gives rise to mature microRNA (miR)-22-3p, which inhibits its target gene, histone deacetylase 4 ( HDAC4 ), thereby increasing the downstream myocyte enhancer factor 2C ( MEF2C ) and ultimately promoting myoblast differentiation. Furthermore, in\u00a0vivo , we documented that Mir22hg knockdown delays repair and regeneration following skeletal muscle injury and further causes a significant decrease in weight following repair of an injured tibialis anterior muscle. Additionally, Mir22hg gives rise to miR-22-3p to restrict HDAC4 expression, thereby promoting the differentiation and regeneration of skeletal muscle. Given the conservation of Mir22hg between mice and humans, Mir22hg might constitute a promising new therapeutic target for skeletal muscle injury, skeletal muscle atrophy, as well as other skeletal muscle diseases. A novel lncRNA, Mir22hg, is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and could give rise to mature miR-22-3p to inhibit HDAC4 expression, thereby activating the downstream MEF2C pathway to promote skeletal muscle differentiation and regeneration."

        "abstract": "Immunogenic cell death is a cell death modality that stimulates the immune system to combat cancer cells. IMMUNEPOTENT CRP (ICRP) is a mixture of substances of low molecular weight obtained from bovine spleens that exhibits in vitro cytotoxic activity on different tumor cell lines and modulates the immune response in vivo . The aim of the present study was to determine whether the cytotoxic effect of ICRP and its combination with oxaliplatin (OXP) on murine melanoma B16F10 cells was due to immunogenic cell death. The cytotoxic assay was performed using flow cytometry to detect Annexin V and propidium iodide staining, and calreticulin (CRT) exposure. Adenosine triphosphate, heat shock protein (HSP) 70, HSP90 and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release were identified using bioluminescence, western blot and ELISA assays, respectively. The present in vitro study demonstrated that treatments with ICRP or OXP induced cell death in a time-dependent manner, but treatment with the combination of ICRP + OXP increased the cytotoxic effect following 24 h of treatment. CRT exposure and release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), HSP70, HSP90 and HMGB1 were induced by treatment with ICRP, and the combination of ICRP + OXP increased the exposure and release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), while OXP treatment only induced CRT exposure, ATP and HMGB1 release. The in vivo experiments demonstrated that administration of tumor-derived DAMP-rich cell lysates derived from B16F10 cells treated with ICRP and the combination of ICRP + OXP prevented melanoma growth; however, OXP treatment did not. These results suggested that IMMUNEPOTENT CRP may be used as an agent to increase the ability of antitumor drugs to induce immunogenic cell death and prevent the growth of melanoma."

        "abstract": "Throughout the world, there are antiretroviral therapy\u2013naive HIV+ individuals who maintain elevated peripheral CD4 + T-cell counts, historically referred to as long-term nonprogressors (LTNPs). With recent improvements in viral load (VL) detection methods to levels as low as 20 copies per milliliter, 2 subsets of LTNPs have been defined: elite controllers (ECs), with undetectable VLs for at least 6\u201312 months, and viremic controllers (VCs), with VLs between 200 and 2000 copies per milliliter. ECs and VCs have been extensively studied in the developed world to determine underlying mechanisms responsible for virologic control. In sub-Saharan Africa, most studies have characterized LTNPs based on immunologic criteria making it difficult to compare findings with the Western cohorts, which use virologic criteria. Here, we describe a cohort of Uganda ECs and VCs attending a large HIV ambulatory center in Kampala, Uganda, based initially on CD4 counts and confirmed by repeated VL measurements. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 14,492 HIV-infected, antiretroviral therapy\u2013naive individuals aged 18 years and older under care for at least 5 years with serial peripheral CD4 counts \u2265500 cells/\u03bcL. Among those, we determined the frequency of individuals with VLs <2000 copies per milliliter for at least 6 months. We report a prevalence of 0.26% (38/14,492) of HIV controllers in the clinic. We identified 36 ECs and 2 VCs. These individuals were middle-aged with an average CD4 count of 858 \u00b1 172 (mean \u00b1 SD, 95% confidence interval: 795 to 921). Their average duration in HIV care was 7.4 \u00b1 2.1 years (mean \u00b1 SD, 95% confidence interval: 6.6 to 8.1). The majority of EC/VCs were women (87%, 33/38), reflecting the demographics of the urban clinic. For the first time, this study demonstrates the frequency of EC/VCs in a large urban clinic in Uganda. Further study of these East African subjects may provide insights into how some individuals are able to control HIV in the absence of medications."

Cutaneous adverse events are among the most frequent immune-related adverse events. The purpose of this case report and literature review is to highlight psoriasis as a potential adverse event with need for early recognition. We describe the case of a 65-year-old woman with psoriasis exacerbation while treated with nivolumab (anti-PD-1) for a stage IV melanoma. She had a history of scalp psoriasis but she presented with psoriatic lesions on both lower and upper limbs. Our patient was treated with topical steroids. So far, 34 other cases with an exacerbation of psoriasis during treatment with anti-PDL-1 or PD-1 therapy have been reported in the literature. A broad range of therapies are described, without any available guidelines for this particular condition. Psoriasis exacerbation is an established side effect of PD-1/PDL-1 checkpoint inhibitors with 35 reported cases. Early recognition and management are challenging as there are no clear guidelines available. A close collaboration between oncologist and dermatologist is mandatory to manage this immune-related adverse event."

Nearly 70%-80% patients with Crohn\u2019s disease would receive surgical treatment during the lifetime. However, surgical treatment is incurable for Crohn\u2019s disease. The challenge of recurrence postoperatively troubles both doctors and patients. Over 50% patients would suffer recurrence postoperatively. Some certain risk factors are associated with recurrence of Crohn\u2019s disease. To evaluate the risk factors for endoscopic recurrence and clinical recurrence after bowel resection in Crohn\u2019s disease. Patients diagnosed Crohn\u2019s disease and received intestinal resection between April 2007 and December 2013 were included in this study. Data on the general demographic information, preoperative clinical characteristics, surgical information, postoperative clinical characteristics were collected. Continuous data are expressed as median (inter quartile range), and categorical data as frequencies and percentages. Kaplan-Meier method was applied to estimate the impact of the clinical variables above on the cumulative rate of postoperative endoscopic recurrence and clinical recurrence, then log-rank test was applied to test the homogeneity of those clinical variables. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors of postoperative endoscopic recurrence and clinical recurrence. A total of 64 patients were included in this study. The median follow-up time for the patients was 17 (9.25-25.75) mo. In this period, 41 patients (64.1%) had endoscopic recurrence or clinical recurrence. Endoscopic recurrence occurred in 34 (59.6%) patients while clinical recurrence occurred in 28 (43.8%) patients, with the interval between the operation and recurrence of 13.0 (8.0-24.5) months and 17.0 (8.0-27.8) mo, respectively. In univariate analysis, diagnosis at younger age ( P < 0.001), disease behavior of penetrating ( P = 0.044) and preoperative use of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ( P = 0.020) were significantly correlated with endoscopic recurrence, while complication with perianal lesions ( P = 0.032) and preoperative use of immunomodulatory ( P = 0.031) were significantly correlated with clinical recurrence. As to multivariate analysis, diagnostic age ( P = 0.004), disease behavior ( P = 0.041) and preoperative use of anti-TNF ( P = 0.010) were independent prognostic factors for endoscopic recurrence, while complication with perianal lesions ( P = 0.023) was an independent prognostic factor for clinical recurrence. Diagnostic age, disease behavior, preoperative use of anti-TNF and complication with perianal lesions were independent risk factors for postoperative recurrence in Crohn\u2019s disease."

Tissue bioimpedance from 10\u00a0kHz to 100\u00a0kHz collected from healthy adults bicep tissues are well represented using the Cole-impedance model, a fractional-order equivalent circuit. The Cole-impedance model parameters extracted from pre-eccentric exercise and post-eccentric exercise timepoints (at 72\u00a0h and 96\u00a0h) show statistically significant decreases of resistances and increases of CPE pseudo-capacitance that align with periods of maximum tissue swelling post-exercise. No significant differences in Cole-impedance model parameters immediately post-fatigue compared to pre-fatigue measures. The purpose of this study is to identify if participation in an eccentric exercise protocol altered the Cole-impedance model parameters that represent localized bicep tissue bioimpedance. This supports continued efforts to identify which features of tissue bioimpedance may be effective markers to non-invasively identify skeletal muscle damage. Here, the Cole-impedance model parameters that best fit the localized electrical impedance of exercised (using an eccentric stimulus) and unexercised biceps of 6 participants (collected before, immediately after and at 24\u00a0h, 48\u00a0h, 72\u00a0h and 96\u00a0h) are determined using a numerical optimization technique. Statistical tests comparing the pre-exercise and post-exercise model parameters report significant decreases in R \u221e and R 1 with significant increases in C at 72\u00a0h and 96\u00a0h post-exercise for exercised biceps (aligning with noted periods of peak swelling). These changes in R \u221e , R 1 , and C were not observed in the unexercised biceps. These results support that the C parameter of the Cole-impedance model fit to bioimpedance data may be a suitable marker for identifying skeletal muscle damage."

Although epileptic, psychiatric, and psychosocial factors are known risk factors for suicide or suicide attempt, no studies have evaluated the predictors of the severity of suicidal ideation-which is a warning sign for suicide attempts-in PWE. Therefore, we measured the severity of suicidal ideation and its risk factors. Consecutive PWE who were medicated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and attended epilepsy clinic were included in the study. The subjects completed self-reported questionnaires, which included the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), and Scale for Suicide Ideation-Beck (SSI-Beck). We compared the patients' demographic and clinical variables, and BDI, BAI, and SCL-90-R scores with their SSI-Beck score, and used our findings to determine the predictors for suicidal ideation. In total, 257 PWE were enrolled in the study. SSI-Beck scores correlated strongly with several seizure-related variables, duration of education, IQ, BDI and BAI scores, and nine domains of the SCL-90-R questionnaire. However, the strongest predictor for suicidal ideation was BDI score (\u03b2=0.41, p <0.001), followed by several SCL-90-R domains, such as obsessive-compulsive (\u03b2=-0.39, p <0.001), depression (\u03b2=0.38, p <0.001), hostility (\u03b2=0.22, p =0.002), paranoid ideation (\u03b2=0.17, p =0.01), and IQ (\u03b2=-0.10, p =0.017). These variables explained 59% of the variance in the SSI-Beck score. The seizure-related variables that influenced the BDI score were seizure frequency, duration of education, MRI abnormality, and number of AEDs. However, these variables explained only 18% of the variance in the BDI score. Major risk factors for suicidal ideation in PWE were depressive and psychiatric symptoms rather than seizure-related variables. Therefore, clinicians should focus on screening for depression and other psychiatric problems and treat them appropriately in order to reduce suicidal behavior in PWE. Since seizure-related variables also exhibited a minor role in determining depressive symptoms, stronger seizure-related risk factors for depression should be sought, such as seizure severity or psychosocial factors, to minimize suicidal behavior."

The protein is central to several critical events in virus production, with its highly druggable nature and rich antigenic determinants making it an excellent anti-viral biomolecule. Docking-based virtual screening using the Asinex anti-viral library identified binding of drug molecules at three specific positions: loop 1 region, loop 2 region and \u03b2-sheet core pockets, the loop 2 region being the most common binding and stable site for the bulk of the molecules. In parallel, the protein was characterized by vaccine design perspective and harboured three potential B cell-derived T cell epitopes: PINTNSSPD, GVPINTNSS, and DHIGTRNPA. The epitopes are highly antigenic, virulent, non-allergic, non-toxic, bind with good affinity to the highly prevalent DRB*0101 allele and show an average population coverage of 95.04%. A multi-epitope vaccine ensemble which was 83 amino acids long was created. This was highly immunogenic, robust in generating both humoral and cellular immune responses, thermally stable, and had good physicochemical properties that could be easily analyzed in in vivo and in vitro studies. Conformational dynamics of both drug and vaccine ensemble with respect to the receptors are energetically stable, shedding light on favourable conformation and chemical interactions. These facts were validated by subjecting the complexes to relative and absolute binding free energy methods of MMGB/PBSA and WaterSwap. A strong agreement on the system stability was disclosed that supported ligand high affinity potential for the receptors. Collectively, this work sought to provide preliminary experimental data of existing anti-viral drugs as a possible therapy for COVID-19 infections and a new peptide-based vaccine for protection against this pandemic virus.

Sap-flux scaled canopy conductance was used to evaluate the effect of drought, disturbance, and mortality of three oak species ( Quercus prinus , Q. velutina , and Q. coccinea ) in an upland oak/pine stand in the New Jersey Pine Barrens from 2005 to 2008. Canopy conductance ( G C ) was analyzed by performing boundary line analysis and selecting for the highest value under a given light condition. Regressing G C with the driving force vapor pressure deficit (VPD) resulted in reference canopy conductance at 1\u2009kPa VPD ( G Cref ). Predictably, drought in 2006 caused G Cref to decline. Q. prinus  G Cref was least affected, followed by Q. coccinea , with Q. velutina having the highest reductions in G Cref . A defoliation event in 2007 caused G Cref to increase due to reduced leaf area and a possible increase in water availability. In Q. prinus , G Cref quadrupled, while doubling in Q. velutina , and increasing by 50% in Q. coccinea . Tree mortality in 2008 led to higher G Cref in the remaining Q. prinus but not in Q. velutina or Q. coccinea . Comparing light response curves of canopy conductance ( G Cref ) and stomatal conductance ( g S ) derived from gas-exchange measurements showed marked differences in behavior. Canopy G Cref failed to saturate under ambient light conditions whereas leaf-level g S saturated at 1,200\u2009\u03bcmol m \u22122 s \u22121 . The results presented here emphasize the differential responses of leaf and canopy-level conductance to saturating light conditions and the effects of various disturbances (drought, defoliation, and mortality) on the carbon and water balance of an oak-dominated forest."

We determined whether 3\u2010hydroxy\u20103\u2010methyl\u2010glutaryl\u2010coenzyme A (HMG\u2010CoA) reductase inhibitors\u2014statins, commonly prescribed to patients at risk of heart failure (HF)\u2014can de\u2010differentiate myofibroblasts, alter cellular bioenergetics, and impact the human ventricular fibroblasts (hVFs) in HF patients. Either in vitro statin treatment of differentiated myofibroblasts ( n =\u00a03\u20136) or hVFs, isolated from human HF patients under statin therapy (HF\u00a0+\u00a0statin) vs. without statins (HF) were randomly used ( n =\u00a04\u201312). In vitro , hVFs were differentiated by transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b21 (TGF\u2010\u03b21) for 72\u00a0h (TGF\u201072\u00a0h). Differentiation status and cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were determined by \u03b1\u2010smooth muscle actin (\u03b1\u2010SMA) expression and Seahorse assay, respectively. Data are mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM except Seahorse (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD); P <\u00a00.05, considered significant. In vitro , statins concentration\u2010dependently de\u2010differentiated the myofibroblasts. The respective half\u2010maximal effective concentrations were 729\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0nmol/L (atorvastatin), 3.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (rosuvastatin), and 185\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0nmol/L (simvastatin). Mevalonic acid (300\u00a0\u03bcmol/L), the reduced product of HMG\u2010CoA, prevented the statin\u2010induced de\u2010differentiation (\u03b1\u2010SMA expression: 31.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010% vs. 58.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012%). Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP, 20\u00a0\u03bcmol/L), a cholesterol synthesis\u2010independent HMG\u2010CoA reductase pathway intermediate, completely prevented the statin\u2010induced de\u2010differentiation (\u03b1\u2010SMA/GAPDH ratios: 0.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05 [TGF\u201072\u00a0h\u00a0+\u00a072\u00a0h], 0.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 [TGF\u201072\u00a0h\u00a0+\u00a0simvastatin], and 1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08 [TGF\u201072\u00a0h\u00a0+\u00a0simvastatin\u00a0+\u00a0GGPP]). Cellular metabolism involvement was observed when co\u2010incubation of simvastatin (200\u00a0nmol/L) with glibenclamide (10\u00a0\u03bcmol/L), a K ATP channel inhibitor, attenuated the simvastatin\u2010induced de\u2010differentiation (0.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05). Direct inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by oligomycin (1\u00a0ng/mL) also produced a de\u2010differentiation effect (0.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02). OCR (pmol O 2 /min/\u03bcg protein) was significantly decreased in the simvastatin\u2010treated hVFs, including basal ( P =\u00a00.002), ATP\u2010linked ( P =\u00a00.01), proton leak\u2010linked ( P =\u00a00.01), and maximal ( P <\u00a00.001). The OCR inhibition was prevented by GGPP (basal OCR [ P =\u00a00.02], spare capacity OCR [ P =\u00a00.008], and maximal OCR [ P =\u00a00.003]). Congruently, hVFs from HF showed an increased population of myofibroblasts while HF\u00a0+\u00a0statin group showed significantly reduced cellular respiration (basal OCR [ P =\u00a00.021], ATP\u2010linked OCR [ P =\u00a00.047], maximal OCR [ P =\u00a00.02], and spare capacity OCR [ P =\u00a00.025]) and myofibroblast differentiation (\u03b1\u2010SMA/GAPDH: 1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19 vs. 0.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06, P =\u00a00.01). This study demonstrates the de\u2010differentiating effect of statins, the underlying GGPP sensitivity, reduced OCR with potential activation of K ATP channels, and their impact on the differentiation magnitude of hVFs in HF patients. This novel pleiotropic effect of statins may be exploited to reduce excessive CF in patients at risk of HF."

At Hospital Kuala Lumpur, we still practice monomodality treatments for AVMs of these three grades. In this study, we wanted to achieve an understanding whether monomodality treatments can achieve a satisfactory outcome of AVM nidi for patients, for up to 3 years, and to gather an objective data for AVM treatment for the Malaysian population. This is a retrospective review of records study. The data are acquired from case notes of patients with intracranial AVM of SMGs I to III who underwent monomodality treatment at Hospital Kuala Lumpur between 2008 and 2011. The patients were followed up with imaging for up to 3 years from the date of treatment. A total of 81 patients were recruited in this study, where 30 underwent microsurgical treatment, 27 underwent embolization, and 24 underwent SRS. Total obliteration of AVM nidus was achieved in 96.7% of patients who underwent microsurgery, 8.7% of patients who underwent embolization, and 79.2% of patients who underwent SRS. The modified Rankin scale (mRS) for all three groups showed an improving trend, with the microsurgery group showing the best improvement (from 70% at 3 months to 92.3% at 3 years showing favorable mRS scores). The AVM nidus obliteration for each treatment group is comparable to the meta-analysis published in 2011. Each modality had its own set of complications; however, most of the patients in all three groups had either static or improved mRS at the end of the 3-year follow-up."

Although whey and whey-derived bioactive compounds can contribute to an improvement in human health, the potential anti-obesity effect of whey bioconversion by LAB has not been well studied. This study aimed to investigate whether bioconversion of whey by Pediococcus pentosaceus KI31 and Lactobacillus sakei KI36 (KI31-W and KI36-W, respectively) inhibits 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. Both KI31-W and KI36-W reduced intracellular lipid accumulation significantly, without decreasing 3T3-L1 preadipocyte proliferation. In addition, obesity-related transcription factor (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3) and genes (adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein and lipoprotein lipase) were down-regulated significantly in 3T3-L1 cells in the presence of KI31-W and KI36-W. Collectively, these results suggest that bioconversion of whey by LAB exhibits anti-adipogenic activity and may be applied as a therapeutic agent for obesity."

To prevent the formation of calciumphosphate deposits (CPD), the body uses adenosine-5\u2019-triphosphate (ATP) to synthesize inhibitors of calcification, including proteins and inhibitors of low molecular weight. Extracellular pyrophosphate (PPi) is a potent inhibitor of VC, which is produced during extracellular hydrolysis of ATP. Loss of function in the enzymes and transporters that are involved in the cycle of extracellular ATP, including Pi transporters, leads to excessive deposition of calcium-phosphate salts. Treatment of hyperphosphatemia with Pi-binders and Injection of exogenous PPi are the effective treatments to prevent CPD in the aortic wall. The role of sodium phosphate cotransporters in ectopic calcification is contradictory and not well defined, but their important role in the control of intracellular Pi levels and the synthesis of ATP make them an important target to study."

Validated human assays for many of these biomarkers have become commercially available, and this study was designed to characterize some of the novel clinical renal biomarkers. The objective of this study was to evaluate clinical renal biomarkers in a typical Phase I healthy volunteer population to determine confidence intervals (pilot reference intervals), intersubject and intrasubject variability, effects of food intake, effect of sex, and vendor assay comparisons. Spot urine samples from 20 male and 19 female healthy volunteers collected on multiple days were analyzed using single analyte and multiplex assays. The following analytes were measured: \u03b1-1-microglobulin, \u03b2-2-microglobulin, calbindin, clusterin, connective tissue growth factor, creatinine, cystatin C, glutathione S-transferase-\u03b1, kidney injury marker-1, microalbumin, N-acetyl-\u03b2-(D) glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, osteopontin, Tamm-Horsfall urinary glycoprotein, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, trefoil factor 3, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Confidence intervals were determined from the single analyte and multiplex assays. Intersubject and intrasubject variability ranged from 38% to 299% and from 29% to 82% for biomarker concentration, and from 24% to 331% and from 10% to 67% for biomarker concentration normalized to creatinine, respectively. There was no major effect of food intake or sex. Single analyte and multiplex assays correlated with r 2 \u22650.700 for five of six biomarkers when evaluating biomarker concentration, but for only two biomarkers when evaluating concentration normalized to creatinine. Confidence intervals as well as intersubject and intrasubject variability were determined for novel clinical renal biomarkers/assays, which should be considered for evaluation in the next steps of the qualification process."

Convalescent plasma has been used to treat a number of infections during pandemics, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and now severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). To summarize the existing literature and registered clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma for treating coronaviruses, and discuss issues of feasibility, and donor and patient selection. A review of articles published in PubMed was performed on 13 July 2020 to summarize the currently available evidence in human studies for convalescent plasma as a treatment for coronaviruses. The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry and clinicaltrials.gov were searched to summarize the currently registered randomized clinical trials for convalescent plasma in COVID-19. There were sixteen COVID-19, four MERS and five SARS reports describing convalescent plasma use in humans. There were two randomized control trials, both of which were for COVID-19 and were terminated early. Most COVID-19 reports described a potential benefit of convalescent plasma on clinical outcomes in severe or critically ill patients with few immediate adverse events. However, there were a number of limitations, including the concurrent use of antivirals, steroids and other treatments, small sample sizes, lack of randomization or control groups, and short follow-up time. Data from SARS and COVID-19 suggest that earlier administration probably yields better outcomes. The ideal candidates for recipients and donors are not known. Still, experience with previous coronaviruses tells us that antibodies in convalescent patients are probably short-lived. Patients who had more severe disease and who are earlier in their course of recovery may be more likely to have adequate titres. Finally, a number of practical challenges were identified. There is currently no effective treatment for COVID-19, and preliminary trials for convalescent plasma suggest that there may be some benefits. However, research to date is at high risk of bias, and randomized control trials are desperately needed to determine the efficacy and safety of this therapeutic option."

We examined e-cigarette susceptibility and ever use prevalence among central Texas middle school students by the level of economic disadvantage (ED) of their school. As a secondary aim, we explored gender and ethnic differences (Hispanic vs. White) in e-cigarette susceptibility across school ED levels. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted of baseline data collected in 2017 as part of the CATCH My Breath study. Participants (n\u202f=\u202f5278) were 6th grade students from 23 central Texas public middle schools. E-cigarette susceptibility/use and demographics were self-reported; school ED was determined by Texas Education Agency. Analyses included chi-square tests and multi-level logistic regression. E-cigarette susceptibility and use varied by school ED for total sample (p\u202f<\u202f.0001) and by ethnicity (p\u202f\u2264\u202f.003). While e-cigarette susceptibility was higher in boys (p\u202f<\u202f.001), no gender differences were found for e-cigarette use. Students in the highest school ED quartile (Q4) (lowest SES) had significantly higher odds of e-cigarette susceptibility (AOR\u202f=\u202f2.01; 95% CI: 1.49\u20132.71) and use (AOR\u202f=\u202f8.12, 95% CI: 2.58\u201326.30) compared with Q1 students. Significant gender differences in e-cigarette susceptibility persisted within school ED quartiles 1\u20133 (p\u202f\u2264\u202f.001); no gender differences were found for Q4 (p\u202f=\u202f.537). Despite overall higher e-cigarette susceptibility for Hispanic students, they had similar prevalence as White students within three school ED quartiles. Findings underscore a higher risk for e-cigarette susceptibility/use among central Texas sixth graders attending high ED schools and provide foundation for further exploration of the school socioeconomic context in adolescent e-cigarette use."

The circuit for charging the capacitor uses the same power source as the biosignal measurement unit. Therefore, variation in main power supply voltage, ground noise, and electromagnetic interference from the charging circuit can induce distortion into the biosignal at the initial stage of charging. In this study, a simple method is proposed for removing the initial irregularity of an electrocardiogram due to the transient state of a power supply. To evaluate the method, a 1-channel electrocardiogram measurement unit and peripheral units were separated from the main control module using galvanic isolation. An isolated push-pull converter was designed to power the secondary side. The method was tested under steady-state and transient conditions. The obtained results proved that biosignal distortion can be significantly reduced. This method could be another simple implementation approach for solving signal distortions due to the transient status of power supplies used in medical devices."

However, Juniperus procera is one of the famous ancient plants that has been traditionally used to treat several diseases such as hyperglycemia, hepatitis, jaundice, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Objective: Current study is an attempt to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of Juniperus procera extract on rats exposed to cytotoxicity caused experimentally by streptozotocin injections. Methods: Five groups of adult Wistar rats (10 rats each) were examined as (Normal control, Normal rats treated with Juniperus procera extract, rats administrated with streptozotocin, rats administrated with streptozotocin and treated with insulin and, rats administrated with streptozotocin and Juniperus procera extract). At the end of the experiment, blood was collected from experimented rats. Animals then were killed and small parts of both pancreas and liver were collected for gene expression and histopathological examination. Results: Serum analysis showed a significant increase in glucose, IL-6, IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in rats exposed to streptozotocin. That change was reduced in rats cotreated with insulin or Juniperus procera extract. Moreover, streptozotocin showed a significant upregulation of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and A2M genes, while, either insulin or Juniperus procera treatment was restored to normal status. Streptozotocin induced inflammation within hepatic tissues which clearly reduced in hepatic tissues of both insulin and junipers cotreated groups. Conclusion: Streptozotocin toxicity induces acute inflammation and increases serum glucose, IL-6, IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 levels. However, Juniperus procera extract was found to significantly prevent that reaction within four weeks experimented frame time."

It occurs in the residual stomach post surgery and in the unoperated stomach. GCP is considered a benign lesion, but there is controversy about its malignant potential. We report a case of early gastric cancer arising from GCP treated by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in a 55-year-old unoperated man. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a 15-mm diameter submucosal tumor (SMT) in the upper corpus of the stomach. The surface had angiotelectasia and slight depression covered with normal mucosa. Neither ulceration nor erosion was seen. Narrow-band imaging endoscopy showed no abnormalities suggesting gastric cancer. Endoscopic ultrasonography visualized the internally low-echoic SMT, harboring tiny cystic lesions, mainly within the second and third layers of the gastric wall. The SMT was removed by ESD to avoid retention and allow for comprehensive diagnosis. It was diagnosed as GCP with partial well-differentiated adenocarcinoma without involvement of the lateral and deep margins, lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion and perineural invasion. The gastric epithelium comprised normal mucosa without dysplasia. ESD seems to be useful for the diagnosis of SMT, including GCP harboring gastric cancer, and avoids unnecessary surgical procedures."

HEV genotypes 3 and 4 have been isolated from both humans and animals, and are recognized as zoonotic pathogens. Seroprevalence studies in animals and humans indirectly suggest that HEV infections occur worldwide. The virus is primarily transmitted to humans via undercooked animal meats in developed countries. Moreover, transfusion- and transplantation-mediated HEV infections have recently been reported.

Sleep problems is the most common side effect of methylphenidate (MPH) treatment in ADHD youth and carry potential to negatively impact long-term self-regulatory functioning. This study aimed to examine whether applying machine learning approaches to pre-treatment demographic, clinical questionnaire, environmental, neuropsychological, genetic, and neuroimaging features can predict sleep side effects following MPH administration. The present study included 83 ADHD subjects as a training dataset. The participants were enrolled in an 8-week, open-label trial of MPH. The Barkley Stimulant Side Effects Rating Scale was used to determine the presence/absence of sleep problems at the 2nd week of treatment. Prediction of sleep side effects were performed with step-wise addition of variables measured at baseline: demographics (age, gender, IQ, height/weight) and clinical variables (ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS) and Disruptive Behavior Disorder rating scale) at stage 1, neuropsychological test (continuous performance test (CPT), Stroop color word test) and genetic/environmental variables (dopamine and norepinephrine receptor gene ( DAT1, DRD4, ADRA2A , and SLC6A2 ) polymorphisms, blood lead, and urine cotinine level) at stage 2, and structural connectivities of frontostriatal circuits at stage 3. Three different machine learning algorithms ((Logistic Ridge Regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), J48) were used for data analysis. Robustness of classifier model was validated in the independent dataset of 36 ADHD subjects. Classification accuracy of LR was 95.5% (area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.99), followed by SVM (91.0%, AUC 0.85) and J48 (90.0%, AUC 0.87) at stage 3 for predicting sleep problems. The inattention symptoms of ADHD-RS, CPT response time variability, the DAT1, ADRA2A DraI , and SLC6A2 A-3081T polymorphisms, and the structural connectivities between frontal and striatal brain regions were identified as the most differentiating subset of features. Validation analysis achieved accuracy of 86.1% (AUC 0.92) at stage 3 with J48. Our results provide preliminary support to the combination of multimodal classifier, in particular, neuroimaging features, as an informative method that can assist in predicting MPH side effects in ADHD."

        "title": "Efficacy and safety of controlled ovarian stimulation using GnRH antagonist protocols for emergency fertility preservation in young women with breast cancer\u2014a prospective nationwide Swedish multicenter study",
        "abstract": "How efficacious and safe are the current approaches to controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) aimed at fertility preservation (FP) in women with breast cancer (BC)? In women with BC undergoing COS aiming at egg/embryo cryopreservation, letrozole-based protocols and those randomly started were equally effective compared with conventional COS, and the overall survival was similar between the women that proceeded to FP and those who did not. Cryopreservation of oocytes and embryos is an established method for FP in women with BC. Recent improvements to COS protocols include concomitant use of letrozole, random-cycle start day of stimulation and the use of GnRHa for the egg maturation trigger. To date, limited sample size of the available studies has not allowed investigation of differences in the efficacy of the different approaches to COS for FP in this patient population. A prospective multicenter study with national coverage including 610 women with BC counseled between 1 January 1995 and 30 June 2017 at six Swedish FP regional programs. After counseling, 401 women elected to undergo COS. Treatments differed in the use or not of concomitant letrozole, a conventional or random-cycle day COS initiation and the use of hCG versus GnRHa trigger for oocyte maturation. Numbers of cryopreserved oocytes and embryos were defined as primary outcome. Pregnancy attempts, reproductive outcomes and long-term survival, investigated by the linking of individuals of the cohort to the total population register of the Swedish Tax Agency (up to 25 November 2018), were evaluated. Using letrozole or not resulted in similar numbers of oocytes and embryos cryopreserved (mean oocytes =\u20099.7 versus 10 and mean embryos 4.0 versus 5.3, respectively), similar to COS with random versus conventional start (mean oocytes 9.0 versus 10.6 and mean embryos 4.8 versus 4.8). In COS with letrozole, a GnRHa trigger was associated with a higher number of oocytes retrieved ( P <\u20090.05) and embryos cryopreserved ( P <\u20090.005), compared with conventional hCG trigger. Of 99 women who returned to fertility clinics after cancer treatment, 32 proceeded to thawing of oocytes or embryos and 10 of them had live births. The all-cause survival between the women that underwent COS and those who did not was similar and did not differ between the two groups. Data on tumor characteristics and estrogen receptor (ER) status were not known for all women at the time of FP counseling and planning of COS, thus protocols with letrozole have been used for both estrogen-sensitive and non-estrogen-sensitive BC. For the same reason, subsequent adjustment for ERs in the BC or tumor characteristics as potential confounders were not performed as these parameters were not available and did not influence the provision of FP through COS. The results of our study support the premise that recently introduced potential improvements to COS protocols for FP in women with BC are efficacious and safe.

A total of 53 septic patients and 16 normal controls who were admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University between January 2019 and December 2020 were enrolled in this study; 6 specimens from the normal group and 15 from the sepsis group were randomly selected for DIA-based quantitative proteomic analysis. The acquired data were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to screen potential markers. The selected proteins were further verified through ELISAs. The differences between control and sepsis groups and between survivors and non-survivors were analysed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to explore their diagnostic value and prognostic efficacy. A total of 149 DEPs were identified by bioinformatics methods. The analyses showed that these proteins are mainly involved in biological processes such as cell movement, stress response, cell proliferation, and immune response. Functional pathway analysis showed that they are mainly involved in leukocyte transendothelial migration, protein synthesis and processing, and various bacterial infections. LGALS3BP was selected as a potential plasma biomarker and further verified through an ELISA. Its level in septic patients was significantly higher than that in normal controls, and its level in non-survivors was also higher than that in survivors. The ROC curves suggested its great diagnostic efficacy and prognostic ability in sepsis. LGALS3BP levels were significantly different between the normal and sepsis groups; it has good diagnostic value in sepsis, and is related to patient prognosis; thus, it might be a biomarker for sepsis."

This is a retrospective cohort analysis of prospectively collected data at a single vascular centre. Between 2001 and 2017, 12 athletes with exercise induced pain underwent investigation and assessment. Patients with significant radiological findings (iliac kinking\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0stenosis demonstrated on duplex ultrasound or catheter angiography) and dynamic flow changes (marked reduction in ankle brachial pressure indices following exertion, or increase in the common iliac artery peak systolic velocity during hip flexion on duplex) underwent surgery after trialling conservative management; the majority were open iliac shortening procedures. Patients with radiological findings, but no dynamic flow changes were managed conservatively. All patients were followed up. There were 10 men and two women with a median age of 40 years. Nine patients had iliac kinking (five in isolation, four associated with stenosis), two had stenosis, and one had no iliac disease. Eight patients had severe symptoms (absolute loss of power on maximal exertion) demonstrated dynamic post-exertional flow changes. Seven patients successfully underwent surgery, returning to their sport at similar intensity. One procedure was abandoned owing to severe adhesions from a prior procedure. This patient subsequently changed sport. Three patients with mild symptoms (two had reduction in power at maximal intensity, one was an incidental finding) and who demonstrated no clinical signs of FLIA continued their sport at a lower intensity. Kinking of the iliac arteries in athletes can occur with or without of iliac stenosis. Patients with the most severe iliac symptoms demonstrate dynamic post-exertional flow limitation and may benefit from surgery following a period of conservative management. Patients who have milder symptoms and no dynamic exercise flow limitations can be managed conservatively. \u2022 This series looks at iliac kinking as a cause of flow limitation in iliac arteries (FLIA) of athletes. \u2022 Iliac kinking is often overlooked in favour of endofibrosis. \u2022 The data demonstrate that iliac kinking can result in FLIA. \u2022 Some of these patients would benefit from surgery, after trailing conservative management.

However, it is still unclear whether other brain regions have iron accumulation as well. In this experiment, rats with rotenone-induced Parkinson\u2019s disease were treated by gastric perfusion of baicalin or intraperitoneal injection of deferoxamine. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that iron accumulated not only in the substantia nigra pars compacta, but also significantly in the striatum globus pallidus, the dentate gyrus granular layer of the hippocampus, the dentate-interpositus and the facial nucleus of the cerebellum. Both baicalin and deferoxamine, which are iron chelating agents, significantly inhibited iron deposition in these brain areas, and substantially reduced the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells. These chelators also reduced iron content in the substantia nigra. In addition to the substantia nigra, iron deposition was observed in other brain regions as well. Both baicalin and deferoxamine significantly inhibited iron accumulation in different brain regions, and had a protective effect on dopaminergic neurons."

        "abstract": "One of the major complaints most people face during aging is an impairment in cognitive functioning. This has a negative impact on the quality of daily life and is even more prominent in patients suffering from neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, schizophrenia, and depression. So far, the majority of cognition enhancers are generally targeting one particular neurotransmitter system. However, recently phosphodiesterases (PDEs) have gained increased attention as a potential new target for cognition enhancement. Inhibition of PDEs increases the intracellular availability of the second messengers cGMP and/or cAMP. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the effects of phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE-Is) on cognition, the possible underlying mechanisms, and the relationship to current theories about memory formation. Studies of the effects of inhibitors of different PDE families (2, 4, 5, 9, and 10) on cognition were reviewed. In addition, studies related to PDE-Is and blood flow, emotional arousal, and long-term potentiation (LTP) were described. PDE-Is have a positive effect on several aspects of cognition, including information processing, attention, memory, and executive functioning. At present, these data are likely to be explained in terms of an LTP-related mechanism of action. PDE-Is are a promising target for cognition enhancement; the most suitable candidates appear to be PDE2-Is or PDE9-Is. The future for PDE-Is as cognition enhancers lies in the development of isoform-specific PDE-Is that have limited aversive side effects."

To overcome these barriers and ensure that rural residents receive the vaccine, officials and communities should look to previous research on how to communicate vaccine information and implement successful vaccination programs in rural areas for guidance and concrete strategies to use in their local efforts.

        "abstract": "The alpha-isoform of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (\u03b1-CaMKII) is expressed abundantly in the forebrain and is considered to have an essential role in synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. Previously, we reported that mice heterozygous for a null mutation of \u03b1-CaMKII (\u03b1-CaMKII+/\u2212) have profoundly dysregulated behaviors including a severe working memory deficit, which is an endophenotype of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. In addition, we found that almost all the neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the mutant mice failed to mature at molecular, morphological and electrophysiological levels. In the present study, to identify the brain substrates of the working memory deficit in the mutant mice, we examined the expression of the immediate early genes (IEGs), c-Fos and Arc, in the brain after a working memory version of the eight-arm radial maze test. c-Fos expression was abolished almost completely in the DG and was reduced significantly in neurons in the CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus, central amygdala, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, c-Fos expression was intact in the entorhinal and visual cortices. Immunohistochemical studies using arc promoter driven dVenus transgenic mice demonstrated that arc gene activation after the working memory task occurred in mature, but not immature neurons in the DG of wild-type mice. These results suggest crucial insights for the neural circuits underlying spatial mnemonic processing during a working memory task and suggest the involvement of \u03b1-CaMKII in the proper maturation and integration of DG neurons into these circuits."

In vitro , A549 and H1299 cells were treated with different concentrations of EGF for 24 h or 48 h. Expression of RFPL3 and hTERT at the mRNA and protein levels was determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis; cell viability was detected by MTT assay, and apoptosis was assayed via flow cytometry. We also pretreated A549 and H1299 cells with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, AG1478 and erlotinib, and MEK-specific inhibitor (PD98059) in the presence of EGF. We used western blot analysis to assess the expression levels of RFPL3, hTERT and related MEK-pathway proteins in A549 and H1299 cells transfected with RFPL3-overexpression plasmids. EGF significantly upregulated RFPL3 and hTERT protein levels in the NSCLC cells. RFPL3 and hTERT proteins upregulation by EGF were attenuated by pretreatment with AG1478 and erlotinib. EGF promoted proliferation and inhibited apoptosis; PD98059 decreased RFPL3 and hTERT protein expression; and RFPL3 overexpression increased the expression of hTERT and related MEK-pathway proteins. EGF upregulated RFPL3 and hTERT protein expression in NSCLC cells via the MEK pathway, promoted cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis. RFPL3 overexpression increased expression of hTERT and related MEK signaling proteins (Ras, Raf, ERK and p-ERK), which implies that RFPL3 is a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC."

The study consisted of two phases: 1) development of QIs and 2) analysis of patient records. A set of QIs was developed based on recommendations in the scientific literature and the Dutch Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) \u201cPhysiotherapy Management and WAD\u201d. QIs were expressed as percentages, allowing target performance levels to be defined (\u226580% or \u226430% depending on whether desired performance required a high or low score on a QI). We then analyzed WAD patient data (N = 810) collected over a period of 16 years in two physiotherapy practices, separating patients into two groups defined as before (Group A 1996\u20132002; n = 353) and after (Group B 2003\u20132011; n = 457) implementation and transition to the Dutch CPG \u201cPhysiotherapy Management and WAD\u201d. Using an iterative process and input from both experts and users, 28 QIs were developed and subsequently classified per step of the clinical reasoning process for physiotherapy care. Based on 16 years of RCD, we found that the clinical reasoning process differed significantly ( P \u2264 0.05) between the groups, in favor of Group B. Twelve of the 25 indicators (48.0%) in Group A and 19 of 26 indicators (73.1%) in Group B met predetermined performance targets. The number of target indicators also differed significantly between groups, favoring Group B ( P \u2264 0.05). A preliminary set of novel QIs was developed. Using RCD and these QIs, we conclude that physiotherapy care in our study setting improved over the period 1996\u20132011. Furthermore, the QIs met the performance targets set for the clinical reasoning process after the transition to the Dutch CPG \u201cPhysiotherapy Management and WAD\u201d."

Monosodium glutamate is a food additive that acts either as food preservatives or as tastiness enhancer. It was confirmed that monosodium glutamate poses a serious responsibility in the pathogenesis of anovulatory infertility. Therefore, the idea of this research was directed to reveal efficiency of Chlorella vulgaris and Spirulina platensis extracts against the ovarian dysfunction resulted due to monosodium glutamate consumption. Adult female albino mice were gavages orally monosodium glutamate alone or with either Chlorella vulgaris or Spirulina platensis aqueous extracts for 28\u202fdays. Female mice were subjected to superovulation to study the oocytes nuclear maturation stages. Histological and quantitative investigation was carried on ovaries. Biochemical assessment to measure the sex hormones level and ovarian enzymatic antioxidants was done. In addition, ovarian antioxidant mRNA genes were determined using quantitative PCR and Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an internal control. The result revealed that monosodium glutamate reduced the oocytes quality and maturation rate, while, both algae improve the oocyte quality and maturation rate than in monosodium glutamate group. Chlorella vulgaris and Spirulina platensis improved the monosodium glutamate ovarian tissue histological alteration, sex hormones content and raised the ovarian enzymatic antioxidants level. In addition, monosodium glutamate markedly diminished the Glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase mRNA expressions, However, Chlorella vulgaris or Spirulina platensis upregulated the expression of genes close to control. In conclusion, Chlorella vulgaris and Spirulina platensis showed potential alleviative role against the monosodium glutamate ovarian dysfunction."

Since the patients\u2019 survival rate has been improved, the patient may experience reductions in physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functions after liver transplantation influencing their adherence to care and treatment. The transplant survival is complex and patients\u2019 adherence to care and treatment should be considered when health care providers make decisions regarding treatment. This qualitative study aimed to explore factors influencing health self-management in adherence to care and treatment among the recipients of care and treatment. In this study, 23 interview sessions were carried out with a total 18 patients, 2 family members and 3 transplantation team members from May to November 2017. The patients were selected using the purposive method from both genders, with a various age range and initial diseases leading to liver transplantation, and time passed from liver transplantation. A semi-structured interview guide was developed based on literature review and pilot interviews. The participants were asked to describe their experiences of self-management behaviors in adherence to treatment and care. The data were analyzed using a conventional content analysis method and managing via the MAXQDA-10 software. Two themes were developed during data analysis as \u201cself-regulation\u201d and \u201cself-care\u201d. \u201cSelf-regulation\u201d consisted of \u201cintentionally changing\u201d, \u201cpositively thinking\u201d, \u201cinformation seeking\u201d, \u201cproblem-solving\u201d, \u201cpast knowledge transferring\u201d, and \u201cself-controlling\u201d. \u201cSelf-care\u201d had three sub-themes \u201cshift to independence\u201d, \u201cvigilance\u201d, and \u201cself-care support\u201d.

Subjects with glenohumeral osteoarthritis and chronic pain (n = 27) received one injection per week for 3 weeks of high molecular weight hyaluronate and were assessed for changes in pain (100 mm visual analog scale [VAS]), range of motion, and the subject\u2019s and physician\u2019s global assessment over 26 weeks. Subjects were also assessed for pain, stiffness, and physical functioning using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC). Finally, responses were evaluated using modified Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials (OMERACT)-Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) Proposition D criteria. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events. High molecular weight hyaluronate significantly improved pain (VAS, WOMAC), range of motion, stiffness, and physical functioning scores; 77.8% of subjects were rated as having an OMERACT-OARSI Proposition D high response. There were no serious adverse events, and none were considered to be related to treatment. Treatment with high molecular weight hyaluronate improves pain, stiffness, and range of motion, and may have an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial may be warranted to investigate further the efficacy and safety of intra-articular high molecular weight hyaluronate for treatment of chronic shoulder pain in patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis."

        "abstract": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been an excellent model system for examining mechanisms and consequences of genome instability. Information gained from this yeast model is relevant to many organisms, including humans, since DNA repair and DNA damage response factors are well conserved across diverse species. However, S. cerevisiae has not yet been used to fully address whether the rate of accumulating mutations changes with increasing replicative (mitotic) age due to technical constraints. For instance, measurements of yeast replicative lifespan through micromanipulation involve very small populations of cells, which prohibit detection of rare mutations. Genetic methods to enrich for mother cells in populations by inducing death of daughter cells have been developed, but population sizes are still limited by the frequency with which random mutations that compromise the selection systems occur. The current protocol takes advantage of magnetic sorting of surface-labeled yeast mother cells to obtain large enough populations of aging mother cells to quantify rare mutations through phenotypic selections. Mutation rates, measured through fluctuation tests, and mutation frequencies are first established for young cells and used to predict the frequency of mutations in mother cells of various replicative ages. Mutation frequencies are then determined for sorted mother cells, and the age of the mother cells is determined using flow cytometry by staining with a fluorescent reagent that detects bud scars formed on their cell surfaces during cell division. Comparison of predicted mutation frequencies based on the number of cell divisions to the frequencies experimentally observed for mother cells of a given replicative age can then identify whether there are age-related changes in the rate of accumulating mutations. Variations of this basic protocol provide the means to investigate the influence of alterations in specific gene functions or specific environmental conditions on mutation accumulation to address mechanisms underlying genome instability during replicative aging."

We aimed to report on the incidence of time\u2010dependent life\u2010threatening events in male and female patients with long QT syndrome with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). A total of 60 patients with long QT syndrome received an ICD for primary or secondary prevention indications. Life\u2010threatening events were evaluated from the date of ICD implant and included ICD shocks for ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or death. ICDs were implanted in 219 women (mean age 38\u00b113\u00a0years), 46 girls (12\u00b15\u00a0years), 55 men (43\u00b117\u00a0years), and 40 boys (11\u00b14\u00a0years). Mean follow\u2010up post\u2010ICD implantation was 14\u00b16\u00a0years for females and 12\u00b16\u00a0years for males. At 15\u00a0years of follow\u2010up, the cumulative probability of life\u2010threatening events was 27% in females and 34% in males (log\u2010rank P =0.26 for the overall difference). In the multivariable Cox model, sex was not associated with significant differences in risk first appropriate ICD shock (hazard ratio, 0.83 female versus male; 95% CI, 0.52\u20131.34; P =0.47). Results were similar when stratified by age and by genotype: long QT syndrome type 1 (LQT1), long QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2), and long QT syndrome type 3 (LQT3). Incidence of inappropriate ICD shocks was higher in males versus females (4.2 versus 2.7 episodes per 100 patient\u2010years; P =0.018), predominantly attributed to atrial fibrillation. The first shock did not terminate ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation in 48% of females and 62% of males ( P =0.25). In patients with long QT syndrome with an ICD, the risk and rate of life\u2010threatening events did not significantly differ between males and females regardless of ICD indications or genotype. In a substantial proportion of patients with long QT syndrome, first shock did not terminate ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation."

        "abstract": "Despite the fact that several natural products (e.g. crude extracts or purified compounds) have been found to activate cell antioxidant responses and/or delay cellular senescence the effect(s) of small peptides on cell viability and/or modulation of protective mechanisms (e.g. the proteostasis network) remain largely elusive. We have thus studied a hexapeptide (Hexapeptide-11) of structure Phe\u2013Val\u2013Ala\u2013Pro\u2013Phe\u2013Pro (FVAPFP) originally isolated from yeast extracts and later synthesized by solid state synthesis to high purity. We show herein that Hexapeptide-11 exhibits no significant toxicity in normal human diploid lung or skin fibroblasts. Exposure of fibroblasts to Hexapeptide-11 promoted dose and time-dependent activation of proteasome, autophagy, chaperones and antioxidant responses related genes. Moreover, it promoted increased nuclear accumulation of Nrf2; higher expression levels of proteasomal protein subunits and increased proteasome peptidase activities. In line with these findings we noted that Hexapeptide-11 conferred significant protection in fibroblasts against oxidative-stress-mediated premature cellular senescence, while at in vivo skin deformation assays in human subjects it improved skin elasticity. Finally, Hexapeptide-11 was found to induce the activity of extracellular MMPs and it also suppressed cell migration. Our presented findings indicate that Hexapeptide-11 is a promising anti-ageing agent. \u2022 Hexapeptide-11 shows no toxicity and promotes dose and time-dependent activation of proteasome, autophagy, chaperones and antioxidant responses related genes. \u2022 Hexapeptide-11 enhances nuclear accumulation of Nrf2; induces higher expression levels of proteasomal protein subunits and increases proteasome peptidase activities. \u2022 Treatment of normal human fibroblasts with Hexapeptide-11 suppresses oxidative-stress-mediated premature cellular senescence. \u2022 Hexapeptide-11 activates extracellular matrix metalloproteinases and suppresses cell migration. \u2022 At in vivo skin deformation assays Hexapeptide-11 improves skin elasticity.

        "abstract": "To delineate the plasma pharmacokinetics and determine the corneal uptake of valine based stereoisomeric dipeptide prodrugs of acyclovir (ACV) in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used for the study. Pharmacokinetics of ACV, L-valine-acyclovir (LACV), L-valine-D-valine-acyclovir (LDACV) and D-valine-L-valine acyclovir (DLACV) prodrugs were delineated. These compounds were administered intravenously as a bolus via jugular vein cannula and orally by gavage. Samples were purified by protein precipitation method and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Pertinent pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained by using WinNonlin. Corneal uptake studies of LDACV and LACV were studied following oral administration. Following i.v. administration, the area under the curve (AUC) in \u03bcM*min of generated ACV was in the order of LACV > LDACV > DLACV indicating their rate of metabolism. The AUC values of total drug obtained in the systemic circulation after oral administration LACV and LDACV were 1077.93 \u00b1 236.09 and 1141.76 \u00b1 73.67 \u03bcM*min, respectively. DLACV exhibited poor oral absorption. C max (\u03bcM) and AUC of the intact prodrug obtained in the systemic circulation following oral administration of LDACV were almost 4\u20135 times higher than LACV. Moreover, concentrations achieved in the cornea after oral administration of LDACV were almost two times of LACV. LDACV increased both the oral bioavailability and subsequent in vivo corneal uptake of ACV. Hence, LDACV can be considered as the most promising drug candidate for delivery of ACV, in treatment of both genital herpes and ocular herpes keratitis after oral administration."

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence and economic burden of peristomal skin complications (PSCs) following ostomy surgery. Retrospective cohort study based on electronic health records and administrative data stores at a large US integrated healthcare system. The sample comprised 168 patients who underwent colostomy (ICD-9-CM 46.1X) (n = 108), ileostomy (46.2X) (n = 40), cutaneous ureteroileostomy (56.5X), or other external urinary diversion (56.6X) (n = 20) between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2014. The study setting was an integrated health services organization that serves more than 2 million persons in the northeastern United States. We scanned electronic health records of all study subjects to identify those with evidence of PSCs within 90 days of ostomy surgery and then examined healthcare utilization and costs over 120 days, beginning with date of surgery, among patients with and without evidence of PSCs. Testing for differences in continuous measures between the 3 ostomy groups was based on one-way analysis of variance; testing for differences in such measures between the PSC and non-PSC groups was based on a t statistic, and the \u03c7 2 statistic was used to test for differences in categorical measures. Sixty-one subjects (36.3%) had evidence of PSCs within 90 days of ostomy surgery (ileostomy, 47.5%; colostomy, 36.1%; urinary diversion, 15.0%; P < .05 for differences between groups). Among patients with evidence of PSCs, the mean (SD) time from surgery to first notation of this complication was 26.4 (19.0) days; it was 24.1 (13.2) days for ileostomy, 27.2 (21.1) days for colostomy, and 31.7 (25.7) days for urinary diversion ( P = .752). Patients with PSCs were more likely to be readmitted to hospital by day 120 (55.7% vs 35.5% for those without PSCs; P = .011). The mean length of stay for patients readmitted to hospital was 11.0 days for those with PSCs and 6.8 days for those without PSCs ( P = .111). The mean total healthcare cost over 120 days was $58,329 for patients with evidence of PSCs and $50,298 for those without evidence of PSCs ( P = .251). Approximately one-third of ostomy patients developed PSCs within 90 days of their surgery. Peristomal skin complications are associated with a greater likelihood of hospital readmission. Our findings corroborate results of earlier studies."

        "abstract": "Ischemic stroke is a common disease with high mortality and morbidity worldwide. One of the important pathophysiological effects of ischemic stroke is apoptosis. A neuroprotective effect is defined as the inhibition of neuronal apoptosis to rescue or delay the infarction in the surviving ischemic penumbra. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol that reportedly prevents cerebral ischemia injury by regulating the expression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the neuroprotective effect of resveratrol on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and to investigate the signaling pathways and mechanisms through which resveratrol regulates apoptosis in the ischemic penumbra. Rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion for 2\u00a0h followed by 24\u00a0h reperfusion. Cerebral infarct volume was measured using 2% TTC staining. TUNEL staining was conducted to evaluate neuronal apoptosis. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the proteins involved in the JAK2/STAT3/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. The results suggested that resveratrol significantly improved neurological function, reduced cerebral infarct volume, decreased neuronal damage, and markedly attenuated neuronal apoptosis; these effects were attenuated by the inhibition of PI3K/AKT with LY294002 and JAK2/STAT3 with AG490. We also found that resveratrol significantly upregulated the expression of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, p-AKT, p-mTOR, and BCL-2 and downregulated expression of cleaved caspase-3 and BAX, which was partially reversed by LY294002 and AG490. These results suggested that resveratrol provides a neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, which is partially mediated by the activation of JAK2/STAT3 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR. Resveratrol may indirectly upregulate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by activating JAK2/STAT3."

The X-ray contrast agent can be the one with increase X-ray absorption, like iodine and a barium X-ray contrast agent or the one with decrease X-ray absorption like air and carbon dioxide contrast agent. Each contrast agent possesses different risks and benefits in various ways. Carbon dioxide as an intravascular contrast agent can be used as an alternative intravascular contrast agent and has superior results in some cases. In patients with renal dysfunction or iodinated contrast allergy, the use of Iodinated Contrast Agent poses the risk of considerable morbidity. Similarly, use of Gadolinium is discouraged in subject with severe renal dysfunction. Use of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) as an intravascular contrast, offers an alternative in such patients for certain procedures, as it is not nephrotoxic and it does not incite allergic reactions. It is inexpensive, readily available and due to its unique physical properties, it can be used to image a wide variety of vascular beds and chambers. The aim of this paper is to systemically review the current literature to describe the indications, contraindications, adverse effects, instruments, precautions, latest methodologies and data supporting for the use of CO 2 as a contrast agent."

We recently developed a concept based on protein domain homology in the human genome to improve variant interpretation. For this purpose, we mapped population variation from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) and pathogenic mutations from the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) onto Pfam protein domains. The aggregation of these variation data across homologous domains into meta\u2010domains allowed us to generate amino acid resolution of genetic intolerance profiles for human protein domains. Here, we developed MetaDome, a fast and easy\u2010to\u2010use web server that visualizes meta\u2010domain information and gene\u2010wide profiles of genetic tolerance. We updated the underlying data of MetaDome to contain information from 56,319 human transcripts, 71,419 protein domains, 12,164,292 genetic variants from gnomAD, and 34,076 pathogenic mutations from ClinVar. MetaDome allows researchers to easily investigate their variants of interest for the presence or absence of variation at corresponding positions within homologous domains. We illustrate the added value of MetaDome by an example that highlights how it may help in the interpretation of variants of unknown significance.

A competency-based curriculum is where we carefully design curricular experiences to achieve pre-identified outcomes. In this study, we aimed to define the outcome objectives of a competency-based undergraduate Obstetrics and Gynaecology curriculum which is comprehensive, and is based on the present day need of our society. These objectives can serve as the basis for designing a suitable curriculum with aligned teaching learning and assessment methods. This is an observational study in which a Delphi technique was used to identify the outcome objectives representing competencies specific to the subject of obstetrics and gynaecology at graduate level. The six core competencies identified by Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Council formed the framework to identify these competencies. Then, a cross-sectional countrywide survey was conducted among purposively sampled teachers and clinical experts through a postal questionnaire to know the relative importance of the identified outcome measures and need for their inclusion in a contemporary outcome-based curriculum. Ninety four medical teachers and clinical experts, belonging to institutes across the county, with demonstrable interest and expertise in the field of medical education identified 38 outcome objectives for the curriculum. There were twenty one \u201cvital\u201d , fourteen \u201cessential\u201d , two \u201cdesirable\u201d and one \u201coptional\u201d outcome objectives identified.

The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone; however, he remained febrile, hypoxemic, continued to require full mechanical ventilator support and his chest X-ray showed increased bilateral infiltrates. The patient was treated with tocilizumab, after which he improved and was successfully extubated. This report illustrates a possible role of tocilizumab in management of cytokine storm in critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection."

Additional physical findings included anteriorly displaced anus, vertebral anomalies, and brachydactyly. The patient's cardiac malformations led to persistent hypotension, sinus tachycardia, and multiorgan failure in the absence of arrhythmias. Rapid whole-exome sequencing was ordered on day of life (DOL) 8. The patient's family elected to withdraw supportive care, and he passed away that evening. Whole-exome sequencing returned posthumously and identified a variant in NAA10 , E100K. The genotype\u2013phenotype was closest to Ogden syndrome or amino-terminal acetyltransferase deficiency. Typical features of this rare X-linked syndrome include progeroid appearance, failure to thrive, developmental delays, hypotonia, and cardiac arrhythmias. Other family members were tested and the patient's mother, who has a history of mild intellectual disability, as well as a daughter born later, were identified as carriers. All carriers showed no cardiac findings. The carrier sister has manifested developmental delay and cortical atrophy. Protein modeling, evolution, dynamics, population variant assessments, and immunoprecipitation depict the deleterious nature of the variant on the interactions of NAA10 with NAA15 . These findings had subsequent implications for posthumous diagnosis of the index patient, for female carriers, and regarding family planning. We highlight how these rapid genetic tests and variant characterization can potentially lead to informed decision-making between health-care providers and family members of patients with critical or lethal conditions when treatment options are limited."

Models included state-level social distancing measures, Census Bureau demographics, daily weather information, and daily air pollution. The primary measures included minimum and maximum daily temperature, precipitation, ozone concentration, PM2.5 concentrations, and U.V. light index. A 1\u200a\u00b0F increase in the minimum temperature was associated with 1.9% (95% CI, 0.2% to 3.6%) increase in deaths 20\u200adays later. An ozone concentration increase of 1\u200appb (part per billion) decreased daily deaths by 2.0% (95% CI, 0.1% to 3.6%); ozone levels below 38\u200appb negatively correlated with deaths.

        "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19), outbreak was first reported in December 2019 in the Wuhan, China. COVID-19 managed to spread worldwide and so far more than 9.1 million cases and more than 4.7 lakh death has been reported globally. Children, pregnant women, elderly population, immunocompromised patients, and patients with conditions like asthma, diabetes, etc. are highly vulnerable to COVID infection. Currently, there is no treatment available for COVID-19 infection. Traditional medicinal plants have provided bioactive molecules in the past that are efficiently used during conditions like cancer, malaria, microbial infections, immune-compromised states, etc. AYUSH India has recommended the use of Curcuma longa, Allium sativum, Ocimum tenuiflorum , and Withania somnifera for immune-boosting during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, we investigated the potential of 63-major bioactive molecules of these plants against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ) through docking studies and compared the results with known inhibitor 11a. Our results proposed cuscohygrine, \u03b3-Glutamyl-S-allylcysteine, anahygrine, and S-allylcystein as the potent inhibitors against M pro identified using molecular docking and molecular simulation dynamics. Interestingly, these molecules are from A. sativum , and W. somnifera , which are known for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory potential. None of the proposed molecules have earlier been reported as antiviral molecules. Our results predict very strong potential of these four-molecules against SARS-CoV-2 M pro , especially \u03b3-glutamyl-S-allylcysteine, as all four form hydrogen bonding with Glu166 that is a crucial residue for the formation of the biologically active dimeric form of M pro . Therefore, we strongly recommend further research on these biomolecules against SARS-CoV-2."

        "abstract": "Autophagy is an essential component of host innate and adaptive immunity. Viruses have developed diverse strategies for evading or utilizing autophagy for survival. The response of the autophagy pathways to virus invasion is poorly documented. Here, we report on the induction of autophagy initiated by the pathogen receptor HSP90AA1 (heat shock protein 90\u00a0kDa \u03b1 [cytosolic], class A member 1) via the AKT-MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin)-dependent pathway. Transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy revealed that intracellular autolysosomes packaged avibirnavirus particles. Autophagy detection showed that early avibirnavirus infection not only increased the amount of light chain 3 (LC3)-II, but also upregulated AKT-MTOR dephosphorylation. HSP90AA1-AKT-MTOR knockdown by RNA interference resulted in inhibition of autophagy during avibirnavirus infection. Virus titer assays further verified that autophagy inhibition, but not induction, enhanced avibirnavirus replication. Subsequently, we found that HSP90AA1 binding to the viral protein VP2 resulted in induction of autophagy and AKT-MTOR pathway inactivation. Collectively, our findings suggest that the cell surface protein HSP90AA1, an avibirnavirus-binding receptor, induces autophagy through the HSP90AA1-AKT-MTOR pathway in early infection. We reveal that upon viral recognition, a direct connection between HSP90AA1 and the AKT-MTOR pathway trigger autophagy, a critical step for controlling infection."

Finding the optimal solar PV and the best locations for the utilization of solar energy in Sudan using HOMER. Investigating the costs and emissions that would be avoided using PV instead of diesel generators. Examining the effect of solar panel price on the project economics. The optimal solar PV was determined to be Studer VarioTrack VT-65 with generic PV. The optimal location for the employment of solar energy in Sudan is Wawa. Electricity access in Africa is a major challenge in rural areas. Despite considerable potential for the use of solar energy, investments in renewable energy projects are minimal due to poor promotion of solar energy. As a result, many people still rely on private diesel generators, which release significant levels of pollutants, and have negative effects on both humans and the environment. Situated in the sunbelt, Sudan is one of the largest countries in Africa endowed with an extremely high solar irradiation potential. However, no work has been done in the literature with a strategic context to study specifically the feasibility of renewable energy systems in Sudan despite the abundance of solar resource. The aim of this study was to utilize Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) to identify the optimal solar photovoltaic (PV) system for Sudan\u2019s conditions, identify the best locations, and analyze the costs and the pollution that might be avoided by employing a PV system in place of a diesel system. HOMER simulation results demonstrated that the optimal type of PV for Sudan is the Studer VarioTrack VT-65 with Generic PV. The utilization of a solar PV system will avoid the production of approximately 27 million kg/year of pollutants and will reduce the cost of energy to USD$ 0.08746/kWh. The optimal locations found in Sudan for utilizing solar energy were Wawa, followed by Kutum, Wadi Halfa, Dongola and Al-Goled due to their low costs of electricity, high clearness index and high levels of solar radiation. Given the recent rapid decrease in PV pricing and predictions for continued reductions, the costs of PV were varied to deliver an understanding on the impact of PV costs on the project economics. Reducing the PV costs by 25% has a significant impact; the cost of energy produced reduces in the range of USD$ 0.06697/kWh and USD$ 0.06808/kWh, while a reduction in PV costs of 50% further reduces the cost of energy, ranging between USD$ 0.05273/kWh and USD$ 0.05361/kWh in the top five locations in Sudan. The output of this study is projected to raising the potentiality awareness of renewable energy in Sudan and delivering a valuable reference regarding the optimal utilization of solar PV system in energy sector."

The major components isolated from Tsoong have been demonstrated to present anti-human immunodeficiency virus-1 activities and cytotoxicity against various tumor cell lines. However, the possible effects of the novel compound isolated from Tsoong, cordifoliketones A, on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, are still unknown. In the present study, cordifoliketones A extractions were prepared from Tsoong, and the possible effects on PDAC cell growth, apoptosis, migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo were exlored. The cytotoxicity assay, apoptosis assay, western blotting, migration and invasion assay, and a PDAC cell (AsPC-1, BxPC-3 and PANC-1) xenograft mice model were employed. The results demonstrated that treatment with cordifoliketones A: i) inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of PDAC cells; ii) significantly induced apoptosis and altered expression of apoptosis-associated proteins in a dose-dependent manner; iii) suppressed migration and invasion of PDAC cells in a dose-dependent manner; and iv) restrained the growth of PDAC neoplasm in nude mice. Furthermore, cordifoliketones A demonstrated non-cytotoxic activity in a panel of normal human cells, including hTERT-HPNE, 293, hepatocyte HL-7702 and HL-1 cells. Therefore, these data indicated that cordifoliketones A may be a potential candidate compound for the prevention of PDAC cell proliferation and metastasis, presumably by induction apoptosis and inhibiting viability, invasion and migration of PDAC cells."

Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to examine the pattern of vimentin and NSE. Also a computerized literature search using Medline and Google scholar was conducted for published articles on OM in Indian population in last 30 years. A total of 32 OM cases reviewed from 25 articles retrieved. Out of them 24 myxomas were present in maxilla, only 8 were in mandible and a single case was present in supraglottic region (larynx). Surgical procedure carried out was excision and curettage in 16 patients and resection with safe margin followed by reconstruction 13 patients. All the three reported cases were successfully treated by tumor enucleation and peripheral ostectomy with no recurrence after 3 to 7 years. Odontogenic myxoma is a rare odontogenic tumor with inconclusive clinical and radiographic features, hence histopathological examination is mandatory to confirm its diagnosis. Although the immunohistochemical analysis may help in diagnosis but plays no role in guiding treatment planning or predicting the rate of recurrence. Currently we lack data on number of reported OM cases in Indian population as author feels more patients must have been treated then reported."

Both fillers achieved a clinically relevant NLF correction (one point or more improvement, based on a validated NLF severity scale). However, JUP displayed greater longevity, with this correction maintained in a significantly larger percentage of NLFs after 6 months (physician\u2019s evaluation) or 9 months (subject\u2019s evaluation) and thereafter for the remainder of the study (70% vs 45%; P = 0.0002 and 62.5% vs 46.3%; P = 0.01 at month 12, based on physician and subject assessments, respectively). At month 12, 71.4% of the subjects nominated a preference for the NLF injected with JUP ( P < 0.0001). Both treatments were well tolerated. These results suggest that different physicochemical properties of HA-based fillers, associated with distinct manufacturing technologies, may influence treatment longevity in the correction of volume deficits. This may relate to a differential resistance to hyaluronidase and/or free radical degradation as previously documented in vitro."

        "abstract": "HeLa and HCT116 cells respond differentially to sorbitol, an osmolyte able to induce hypertonic stress. In these models, sorbitol promoted the phenotypic manifestations of early apoptosis followed by complete loss of viability in a time-, dose-, and cell type-specific fashion, by eliciting distinct yet partially overlapping molecular pathways. In HCT116 but not in HeLa cells, sorbitol caused the mitochondrial release of the caspase-independent death effector AIF, whereas in both cell lines cytochrome c was retained in mitochondria. Despite cytochrome c retention, HeLa cells exhibited the progressive activation of caspase-3, presumably due to the prior activation of caspase-8. Accordingly, caspase inhibition prevented sorbitol-induced killing in HeLa, but only partially in HCT116 cells. Both the knock-out of Bax in HCT116 cells and the knock-down of Bax in A549 cells by RNA interference reduced the AIF release and/or the mitochondrial alterations. While the knock-down of Bcl-2/Bcl-X L sensitized to sorbitol-induced killing, overexpression of a Bcl-2 variant that specifically localizes to mitochondria (but not of the wild-type nor of a endoplasmic reticulum-targeted form) strongly inhibited sorbitol effects. Thus, hyperosmotic stress kills cells by triggering different molecular pathways, which converge at mitochondria where pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family exert their control."

This study was designed to find a dose of intrathecal fentanyl, which can improve the quality of surgical anesthesia with minimal side effects in parturients undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia with intrathecal bupivacaine. In a prospective randomized double-blind study, 243 parturients undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive 10, 15, or 25 \u03bcg of intrathecal fentanyl with 10 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine. Patients were assessed for clinical efficacy by measuring pain score, need for rescue analgesia, conversion to general anesthesia, and complaints of inadequacy of surgical anesthesia by the surgeon. The side effects assessed were pruritus, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and decrease in saturation and respiratory rate. In addition, neonatal APGAR score, patients' hemodynamics, need for vasopressors, onset and duration of sensory, and motor block were measured. Patients receiving 25 \u03bcg of fentanyl had a significantly higher incidence of pruritus, nausea, and dizziness in addition to a significantly prolonged sensory and motor block ( P < 0.001). All patients in three groups had adequate surgical anesthesia with no statistically significant difference in the onset of block, quality of surgical anesthesia, pain scores, neonatal APGAR score, hemodynamic variables, and need for vasopressor. For patients undergoing cesarean section, 10 or 15 \u03bcg of intrathecal fentanyl with 10 mg of bupivacaine provided adequate surgical anesthesia and analgesia with minimal side effects."

Saudi and global health agencies have provided various COVID-19 knowledge tools and facts to the general public. Therefore, this study aims to assess COVID-19 knowledge among the general public in Saudi Arabia at the early stages of the pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted in March 2020 in Saudi Arabia. The study included 1006 participants who responded to a random online COVID-19 public knowledge questionnaire that included five sections: demographic characteristics, general knowledge, prevention practices, home quarantine measures, and knowledge of governmental restrictions. Three levels of knowledge were established: excellent, intermediate, and poor. Differences in the percentages of participants with different knowledge levels by the demographic variables were analyzed using the chi-square test. Regarding overall general knowledge of COVID-19, 75%, 24%, and 1% of the participants had excellent, intermediate, and poor knowledge levels, respectively. Knowledge levels were significantly different by nationality and age (P=0.027 and 0.008, respectively). Most participants (98.4%) reported excellent knowledge of prevention practices, with no statistically significant differences among groups (P>0.005). Older age groups reported higher knowledge of home quarantine measures (86.6% and 86.4% of the 51\u201360 and older than 60 age groups, respectively, P=0.001). High levels of knowledge about the virus, including prevention practices, are essential. The provision of COVID-19 facts and knowledge tools should be focused on younger generations to enhance compliance with the governmental restrictions required to stop the spread of COVID-19."

Three cohorts of 6 healthy volunteers received 2 treatments with microdoses of rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban alone and with coadministration of 1 of the perpetrators. Plasma and urine concentrations of microdosed apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban were quantified using a validated ultra\u2010performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry with a lower limit of quantification of 2.5 pg/mL. Voriconazole caused only a minor interaction with apixaban and rivaroxaban, none with edoxaban.

A single dose of rifampicin decreased the volume of distribution and elimination half\u2010life of all 3 FXaI. The microdosed FXaI cocktail approach is able to generate drug interaction data and can help elucidating the mechanism involved in the clearance of the different victim drugs.

Paired end reads were generated for 104 samples using Illumina MiSeq next-generation se-quencing. 63 sequences belonged to previously identified local transmission networks of PWID (LTNs) of an HIV outbreak in Athens, Greece. For two HIV-RNA cut-offs (105 and 106 IU/mL), HIV transmissions were more likely between PWID with similar levels of HIV-RNA (p<0.001). 10 of the 14 sequences (71.4%) from PWID with HIV-RNA >106 IU/mL were clustered in 5 pairs. For 4 of these clusters (80%), there was in each one of them at least one sequence from a recently HIV-infected PWID. We showed that transmissions are more likely among PWID with high viremia."

However, the location and character of many of the causal mutations in LDS would intuitively infer diminished TGF-\u03b2 signaling 5 . Taken together, these data have engendered controversy regarding the specific role of TGF-\u03b2 in disease pathogenesis. Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) has considerable phenotypic overlap with MFS and LDS, including aortic aneurysm 6 - 8 . We identified causative variation in 10 patients with SGS in the proto-oncogene SKI , a known repressor of TGF-\u03b2 activity 9 , 10 . Cultured patient dermal fibroblasts showed enhanced activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling cascades and increased expression of TGF-\u03b2 responsive genes. Morpholino-induced silencing of SKI paralogs in zebrafish recapitulated abnormalities seen in SGS patients. These data support the conclusion that increased TGF-\u03b2 signaling is the mechanism underlying SGS and contributes to multiple syndromic presentations of aortic aneurysm."

Treating severe paradoxical psoriasis is challenging because the reported cases are rare, with treatment experience being only anecdotal. We report 2 cases of paradoxical psoriasis caused by infliximab. Both cases manifested with a significant number of pustular lesions and had protracted and complicated clinical courses. In case 1, secukinumab alone could not control the eruptions, but colchicine supplementation markedly decreased disease activity. In case 2 miscellaneous medications were administered, including the systemic drug acitretin, the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine, and the biologic agent ustekinumab. However, multiple applications of those medications failed to prevent new lesions from occurring. Both cases showed moderate-to-high anti-nuclear antibody titers. Based on these cases, moderate-to-high anti-nuclear antibody titer seems to be a risk factor for paradoxical psoriasis. In addition, extensive pustular presentation may be a negative prognostic indicator and may portend a protracted clinical course refractory to therapy."

This study aimed to determine the expression of the clock genes Clock and Bmal1, in the pineal gland of rats with hypoxic-ischemic brain damage. Results showed that levels of Clock mRNA were not significantly changed within 48 hours after cerebral hypoxia and ischemia. Expression levels of CLOCK and BMAL1 protein were significantly higher after 48 hours. The levels of Bmal1 mRNA reached a peak at 36 hours, but were significantly reduced at 48 hours. Experimental findings indicate that Clock and Bmal1 genes were indeed expressed in the pineal glands of neonatal rats. At the initial stage (within 36 hours) of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage, only slight changes in the expression levels of these two genes were detected, followed by significant changes at 36\u201348 hours. These changes may be associated with circadian rhythm disorder induced by hypoxic-ischemic brain damage."

While most pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 cases are not life threatening, some children have severe disease requiring emergent resuscitative interventions. Resuscitation events present risks to healthcare provider safety and the potential for compromised patient care. Current resuscitation practices and policies for children with suspected/confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 are unknown. Multi-institutional survey regarding inpatient resuscitation practices during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Internet-based survey. U.S. PICU representatives (one per institution) involved in resuscitation system planning and oversight. None. Of 130 institutions surveyed, 78 (60%) responded. Forty-eight centers (62%) had admitted coronavirus disease 2019 patients; 26 (33%) reported code team activation for patients with suspected/confirmed coronavirus disease 2019. Sixty-seven respondents (86%) implemented changes to inpatient emergency response systems. The most common changes were as follows: limited number of personnel entering patient rooms (75; 96%), limited resident involvement (71; 91%), and new or refined team roles (74; 95%). New or adapted technology is being used for coronavirus disease 2019 resuscitations in 58 centers (74%). Most institutions (57; 73%) are using enhanced personal protective equipment for all coronavirus disease 2019 resuscitation events; 18 (23%) have personal protective equipment policies dependent on the performance of aerosol generating procedures. Due to coronavirus disease 2019, most respondents are intubating earlier during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (56; 72%), utilizing video laryngoscopy (67; 86%), pausing chest compressions during laryngoscopy (56; 72%), and leaving patients connected to the ventilator during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (56; 72%). Responses were varied regarding airway personnel, prone cardiopulmonary resuscitation, ventilation strategy during cardiopulmonary resuscitation without an airway in place, and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Most institutions (46; 59%) do not have policies regarding limitations of resuscitation efforts in coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Most U.S. pediatric institutions rapidly adapted their resuscitation systems and practices in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Changes were commonly related to team members and roles, personal protective equipment, and airway and breathing management, reflecting attempts to balance quality resuscitation with healthcare provider safety."

The aim of this study is to promote the use of telemedicine via videoconferencing to reduce human exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and reduce the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission at outpatient clinics. The COVID-19 pandemic is the biggest healthcare crisis in the 21st century. Until a vaccine is developed or herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is achieved, social distancing to avoid crowding is an important strategy to reduce disease transmission and resurgence. Telemedicine has already been applied in the field of orthopedics with encouraging results. We reviewed the evidence behind telemedicine and described our clinical protocol, patient selection criteria, and workflow for telemedicine. We discussed a simple methodology to convert pre-existing traditional clinic resources into telemedicine tools, along with future challenges. Our methodology was successfully and easily applied in our clinical practice, with a streamlined workflow allowing our spine surgery service to implement telemedicine as a consultation modality in line with the national recommendations of social distancing. Telemedicine was well incorporated into our outpatient practice using the above workflow. We believe that the use of telemedicine via videoconferencing can become part of the new normal and a safe strategy for healthcare systems as both a medical and an economic countermeasure against COVID-19."

        "abstract": "Nottingham's modification of Bloom\u2013Richardson histopathological grading system (NGS) for carcinoma breast is a time-tested prognostic indicator; however, of lately, breast cancer has been evaluated through molecular techniques, particularly assessing the gene expression profiling and establishing molecular or immunophenotypes. The present-day utility of NGS needs to be reassessed with the modern predictive markers, this may help refine breast cancer classification specifically to help improve the treatment protocol. The objective was to compare breast cancer immunophenotypes with prognostic factors such as age (based on menstrual status), tumor size, lymph node (LN) status, also to compare the NGS grade with the molecular immunphenotypes of breast cancer. The present work was carried out in the Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry section of Department of Pathology, of a central Indian medical college and rural hospital from January 2013 to July 2016. It was a prospective analytical study. A tota1 of 114 female patients presenting in the outpatient department of surgery with lump in breast were included in the present study. All patients underwent modified radical mastectomy for tumor resection. Tumor masses and LNs were subjected to routine hematoxylin and eosin staining as well as immunohistochemistry then examined by a senior pathologist. Comparisons were made between molecular immunophenotypes with patient age, tumor size, and LN status, further NGS grade of breast cancer was compared with immunophenotypes. The study found that the molecular immunophenotypes when compared with clinical prognostic parameters, i.e; age (based on menstrual status of female), LN involvement in patients of breast carcinoma showed inconsequential correlation, the tumor size showed significant correlation. However, when histopathological grades were compared with molecular immunophenotypes, a significant correlation was seen. NGS grade being an excellent predictive prognostic tool should be continued for assessing the grades in breast cancer patients. The molecular markers correlate with the histopathological grading and indirectly aid the oncologist in assessing the aggressiveness, these immunophenotypes are not helpful as suitable prognostic tools. As the molecular phenotypes definitely indicate the hormonal receptor status in breast cancer patients, they become mandatory in guiding oncologists for planning the treatment strategy and protocol."

Here we report the crystal structure of the trans-membrane domain of human CRF1R in complex with the small-molecule antagonist CP-376395 in a hex-agonal setting with translational non-crystallographic symmetry. Molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations on this novel structure and the existing TMD structure for CRF1R provides insight as to how the small molecule ligand gains access to the induced-fit allosteric binding site with implications for the observed selectivity against CRF2R. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations performed using a full-length receptor model point to key interactions between the ECD and extracellular loop 3 of the TMD providing insight into the full inactive state of multidomain class B GPCRs."

There was a significant decrease in mean heart rate, mean systolic blood pressure, sedation score, pain score, and delayed the first request for analgesics postoperatively in group (II) and group (III) compared to group (I) 2 h postoperatively. There was no significant difference in group (III) compared to group (II) postoperatively. The incidence of postoperative side effects was more in group (III). The single oral preoperative dose administration of pregabalin had significant opioid-sparing effect in the first 6 h after surgery, whereas side effects were more common with administration of pregabalin 300 mg."

        "abstract": "there is a significant gap in the understanding, assessment and management of people with dementia and concurrent hearing and vision impairments. from the perspective of professionals in dementia, hearing and vision care, we aimed to: (1) explore the perceptions of gaps in assessment and service provision in ageing-related hearing, vision and cognitive impairment; (2) consider potential solutions regarding this overlap and (3) ascertain the attitudes, awareness and practice, with a view to implementing change. our two-part investigation with hearing, vision, and dementia care professionals involved: (1) an in-depth, interdisciplinary, international Expert Reference Group (ERG; n = 17) and (2) a wide-scale knowledge, attitudes and practice survey ( n = 653). The ERG involved consensus discussions around prototypic clinical vignettes drawn from a memory centre, an audiology clinic, and an optometry clinic, analysed using an applied content approach. the ERG revealed several gaps in assessment and service provision, including a lack of validated assessment tools for concurrent impairments, poor interdisciplinary communication and care pathways, and a lack of evidence-based interventions. Consensus centred on the need for flexible, individualised, patient-centred solutions, using an interdisciplinary approach. The survey data validated these findings, highlighting the need for clear guidelines for assessing and managing concurrent impairments. this is the first international study exploring professionals\u2019 views of the assessment and care of individuals with age-related hearing, vision and hearing impairment. The findings will inform the adaptation of assessments, the development of supportive interventions, and the new provision of services."

        "abstract": "Acne is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that involves the pathogenesis of four major factors, such as androgen-induced increased sebum secretion, altered keratinization, colonization of Propionibacterium acnes , and inflammation. Several acne mono-treatment and combination treatment regimens are available and prescribed in the Indian market, ranging from retinoids, benzoyl peroxide (BPO), anti-infectives, and other miscellaneous agents. Although standard guidelines and recommendations overview the management of mild, moderate, and severe acne, relevance and positioning of each category of pharmacotherapy available in Indian market are still unexplained. The present article discusses the available topical and oral acne therapies and the challenges associated with the overall management of acne in India and suggestions and recommendations by the Indian dermatologists. The experts opined that among topical therapies, the combination therapies are preferred over monotherapy due to associated lower efficacy, poor tolerability, safety issues, adverse effects, and emerging bacterial resistance. Retinoids are preferred in comedonal acne and as maintenance therapy. In case of poor response, combination therapies BPO-retinoid or retinoid-antibacterials in papulopustular acne and retinoid-BPO or BPO-antibacterials in pustular-nodular acne are recommended. Oral agents are generally recommended for severe acne. Low-dose retinoids are economical and have better patient acceptance. Antibiotics should be prescribed till the inflammation is clinically visible. Antiandrogen therapy should be given to women with high androgen levels and are added to regimen to regularize the menstrual cycle. In late-onset hyperandrogenism, oral corticosteroids should be used. The experts recommended that an early initiation of therapy is directly proportional to effective therapeutic outcomes and prevent complications."

        "abstract": "The severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) population compared with that in normal glucose tolerance (NGT) individuals has not yet been quantitatively assessed. We investigated the prevalence and the severity of NAFLD in a T2DM population using controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). Subjects who underwent testing for biomarkers related to T2DM and CAP using Fibroscan\u00ae during a regular health check-up were enrolled. CAP values of 250 dB/m and 300 dB/m were selected as the cutoffs for the presence of NAFLD and for moderate to severe NAFLD, respectively. Biomarkers related to T2DM included fasting glucose/insulin, fasting C-peptide, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), glycoalbumin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Among 340 study participants (T2DM, n=66; pre-diabetes, n=202; NGT, n=72), the proportion of subjects with NAFLD increased according to the glucose tolerance status (31.9% in NGT; 47.0% in pre-diabetes; 57.6% in T2DM). The median CAP value was significantly higher in subjects with T2DM (265 dB/m) than in those with pre-diabetes (245 dB/m) or NGT (231 dB/m) (all p<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that subjects with moderate to severe NAFLD had a 2.8-fold (odds ratio) higher risk of having T2DM than those without NAFLD ( p =0.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.21\u20136.64), and positive correlations between the CAP value and HOMA-IR (\u03c1=0.407) or fasting C-peptide (\u03c1=0.402) were demonstrated. Subjects with T2DM had a higher prevalence of severe NAFLD than those with NGT. Increased hepatic steatosis was significantly associated with the presence of T2DM, and insulin resistance induced by hepatic fat may be an important mechanistic connection."

Nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 3 (NFE2L3), also known as NRF3, is a member of the cap \u2018n\u2019 collar basic-region leucine zipper family of transcription factors. NFE2L3 is involved in the regulation of various biological processes, whereas its role in HCC has not been elucidated. To explore the expression and biological function of NFE2L3 in HCC. We analyzed the expression of NFE2L3 in HCC tissues and its correlation with clinicopathological parameters based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) interference technology was utilized to knock down NFE2L3 in vitro . Cell apoptosis, clone formation, proliferation, migration, and invasion assays were used to identify the biological effects of NFE2L3 in BEL-7404 and SMMC-7721 cells. The expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers was examined by Western blot analysis. TCGA analysis showed that NFE2L3 expression was significantly positively correlated with tumor grade, T stage, and pathologic stage. The qPCR and Western blot results showed that both the mRNA and protein levels of NFE2L3 were significantly decreased after shRNA-mediated knockdown in BEL-7404 and SMMC-7721 cells. The shRNA-mediated knockdown of NFE2L3 could induce apoptosis and inhibit the clone formation and cell proliferation of SMMC-7721 and BEL-7404 cells. NFE2L3 knockdown also significantly suppressed the migration, invasion, and EMT of the two cell lines. Our study showed that shRNA-mediated knockdown of NFE2L3 exhibited tumor-suppressing effects in HCC cells."

A new, nonsurgical treatment option has become available for women who have failed conservative therapy, but its cost effectiveness has not been evaluated. This study examined the cost effectiveness of transurethral radiofrequency microremodeling of the female bladder neck and proximal urethra compared with synthetic transobturator tape (TOT), retropubic transvaginal tape (TVT) sling, and Burch colposuspension surgeries for treating SUI. A Markov model was used to compare the cost effectiveness of five strategies for treating SUI for patients who had previously failed conservative therapy. The strategies were designed to compare the value of starting with a less invasive treatment. The cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the health care system perspective. Efficacy and adverse event rates were obtained from the literature; reimbursement costs were based on Medicare fee schedule. The model cycle was 3\u00a0months, with a 3-year time horizon. Single-variable sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess stability of base-case results. Two of the five strategies employed the use of transurethral radiofrequency microremodeling and achieved 17\u201330\u00a0% lower mean costs relative to their comparative sling or Burch strategies. Superior safety and cost effectiveness are recognized when patients are offered a sequential approach to SUI management that employs transurethral radiofrequency microremodeling before invasive surgical procedures. This sequential approach is consistent with treatment strategies for other conditions and offers a solution for women with SUI who want to avoid the inherent risks and costs of invasive continence surgery."

        "abstract": "In the last 40 years, the United States invested over 200 billion dollars on cancer research, resulting in only a 5% decrease in death rate. A major obstacle for improving patient outcomes is the poor understanding of mechanisms underlying cellular migration associated with aggressive cancer cell invasion, metastasis and therapeutic resistance 1 . Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), the most prevalent primary malignant adult brain tumor 2 , exemplifies this difficulty. Despite standard surgery, radiation and chemotherapies, patient median survival is only fifteen months, due to aggressive GBM infiltration into adjacent brain and rapid cancer recurrence 2 . The interactions of aberrant cell migratory mechanisms and the tumor microenvironment likely differentiate cancer from normal cells 3 . Therefore, improving therapeutic approaches for GBM require a better understanding of cancer cell migration mechanisms. Recent work suggests that a small subpopulation of cells within GBM, the brain tumor stem cell (BTSC), may be responsible for therapeutic resistance and recurrence. Mechanisms underlying BTSC migratory capacity are only starting to be characterized 1,4 . Due to a limitation in visual inspection and geometrical manipulation, conventional migration assays 5 are restricted to quantifying overall cell populations. In contrast, microfluidic devices permit single cell analysis because of compatibility with modern microscopy and control over micro-environment 6-9 . We present a method for detailed characterization of BTSC migration using compartmentalizing microfluidic devices. These PDMS-made devices cast the tissue culture environment into three connected compartments: seeding chamber, receiving chamber and bridging microchannels. We tailored the device such that both chambers hold sufficient media to support viable BTSC for 4-5 days without media exchange. Highly mobile BTSCs initially introduced into the seeding chamber are isolated after migration though bridging microchannels to the parallel receiving chamber. This migration simulates cancer cellular spread through the interstitial spaces of the brain. The phase live images of cell morphology during migration are recorded over several days. Highly migratory BTSC can therefore be isolated, recultured, and analyzed further. Compartmentalizing microfluidics can be a versatile platform to study the migratory behavior of BTSCs and other cancer stem cells. By combining gradient generators, fluid handling, micro-electrodes and other microfluidic modules, these devices can also be used for drug screening and disease diagnosis 6 . Isolation of an aggressive subpopulation of migratory cells will enable studies of underlying molecular mechanisms."

However, current internationally accepted genetic testing referral guidelines are built mostly on data from cancer genetics clinics in women of European descent. To evaluate the appropriateness of such guidelines in Asians, we have determined the prevalence of germ line variants in an unselected cohort of Asian patients with breast cancer and healthy controls. Germ line DNA from a hospital-based study of 2575 unselected patients with breast cancer and 2809 healthy controls were subjected to amplicon-based targeted sequencing of exonic and proximal splice site junction regions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 using the Fluidigm Access Array system, with sequencing conducted on a Illumina HiSeq2500 platform. Variant calling was performed with GATK UnifiedGenotyper and were validated by Sanger sequencing. Fifty-five (2.1%) BRCA1 and 66 (2.6%) BRCA2 deleterious mutations were identified among patients with breast cancer and five (0.18%) BRCA1 and six (0.21%) BRCA2 mutations among controls. One thousand one hundred and eighty-six (46%) patients and 97 (80%) carriers fulfilled the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for genetic testing. Five per cent of unselected Asian patients with breast cancer carry deleterious variants in BRCA1 or BRCA2 . While current referral guidelines identified the majority of carriers, one in two patients would be referred for genetic services. Given that such services are largely unavailable in majority of low-resource settings in Asia, our study highlights the need for more efficient guidelines to identify at-risk individuals in Asia."

Here, we aimed to disclose the role of MNX1-AS1 in LSCC progression, and explore whether MNX1-AS1 participates in LSCC progression via targeting miR-744-5p to active BCL9/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Sixty-five human LSCC tissues and the paracancerous normal tissues were recruited to determine the levels of MNX1-AS1, miR-744-5p and BCL9 using qRT-PCR. The interaction of miR-744-5p and MNX1-AS1/BCL9 was determined by using the RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay and/or luciferase gene reporter assay. Cell viability, in vivo tumor formation, invasion and migration abilities were detected by MTT, Xenograft models and Transwell assays. MNX1-AS1 level was increased significantly in human LSCC tissues as compared with the normal tissues, which showed a positive correlation with BCL9 level while a negative correlation with miR-744-5p level. High level of MNX1-AS1 predicted a poor prognosis and an advanced clinical process in LSCC patients. miR-744-5p targeted upregulation weakened the luciferase activity of MNX1-AS1 and /BCL9, and downregulated their expression levels-wt, while showed no effect when the binding sites were mutated. Knockdown of MNX1-AS1 markedly weakened cell viability, migration, and invasion abilities, while BCL9 overexpression abolished these tendencies. In addition, MNX1-AS1 downregulation induced decreases in tumor volumes and weights in vivo , accompanied by reductions in BCL9, Ki-67 and \u03b2-catenin expression and an increase in miR-744-5p expression. Collectively, this study reveals that MNX1-AS1 contributes to cell growth and migration by regulating miR-744-5p/BCL9/\u03b2-catenin axis in LSCC."

The postpartum period can pose significant risks and challenges, particularly for women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Remote blood pressure monitoring has proven feasible and acceptable among women and providers but has not been widely implemented or researched. Early studies have identified improved outcomes with use of telehealth, including increased compliance with care and decreased disparity in hypertension follow-up. Preliminary data make a compelling case for remote monitoring as a promising treatment strategy to manage postpartum hypertension. Remote monitoring technology should be incorporated as a standard component for the comprehensive management of postpartum hypertension during COVID-19. As a consequence of the pandemic, we now have an opportunity to research the impact of postpartum remote blood pressure monitoring on maternal outcome and disparities within these outcomes."

Three months after the switch, the efficacy of galantamine was evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and NPI Brief Questionnaire Form (NPI-Q), respectively, using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. NPI scores improved significantly on BPSD, especially on delusions, agitation and aberrant motor activity in AD patients (p = 0.027); improvement was remarkable in patients with moderate AD (MMSE score 10-19; p = 0.007), while insignificant in those with MCI (MMSE score \u226524; p = 0.648). The NPI-Q score also improved significantly regarding both the severity of the disease (p = 0.009) and caregiver distress (p = 0.012) in AD patients. MMSE scores hardly improved in either MCI (p = 0.394) or AD patients (p = 0.265). An uninterrupted switch from donepezil to galantamine could be a useful alternative treatment option for AD patients whose BPSD are unresponsive to donepezil, or whose caregivers are not satisfied with donepezil treatment. \u00a9 2014 S.

Therefore, herein we aimed at evaluating the effect of BPA exposition both in vivo and in vitro on H 2 O 2 generation in thyrocytes, besides other essential steps for TH synthesis. Female Wistar rats were treated with vehicle (control) or BPA 40\u2009mg/kg BW for 15 days, by gavage. We then evaluated thyroid iodide uptake, mediated by sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), thyroperoxidase (TPO) and dual oxidase (DOUX) activities (H 2 O 2 generation). Hydrogen peroxide generation was increased, while iodide uptake and TPO activity were reduced by BPA exposition. We have also incubated the rat thyroid cell line PCCL3 with 10 \u22129 M BPA and evaluated Nis and Duox mRNA levels, besides H 2 O 2 generation. Similar to that found in vivo , BPA treatment also led to increased H 2 O 2 generation in PCCL3. Nis mRNA levels were reduced and Duox2 mRNA levels were increased in BPA-exposed cells. To evaluate the importance of oxidative stress on BPA-induced Nis reduction, PCCL3 was treated with BPA in association to N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant, which reversed the effect of BPA on Nis . Our data suggest that BPA increases ROS production in thyrocytes, what could lead to oxidative damage thus possibly predisposing to thyroid disease."

        "abstract": "Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Secondary cardiovascular risk reduction therapy (consisting of an aspirin, a \u03b2-blocker, an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker and a statin) is needed for all patients with ACS. Less than 80% of patients with ACS in Qatar use this combination after discharge. This study is aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of clinical pharmacist-delivered intervention at discharge and tailored follow-up postdischarge on decreasing hospital readmissions, emergency department (ED) visits and mortality among patients with ACS. A prospective, randomised controlled trial will be conducted at the Heart Hospital in Qatar. Patients are eligible for enrolment if they are at least 18\u2005years of age and are discharged from any non-surgical cardiology service with ACS. Participants will be randomised into 1 of 3 arms: (1) \u2018control\u2019 arm which includes patients discharged during weekends or after hours; (2) \u2018clinical pharmacist delivered usual care at discharge\u2019 arm which includes patients receiving the usual care at discharge by clinical pharmacists; and (3) \u2018clinical pharmacist-delivered structured intervention at discharge and tailored follow-up postdischarge\u2019 arm which includes patients receiving intensive structured discharge interventions in addition to 2 follow-up sessions by intervention clinical pharmacists. Outcomes will be measured by blinded research assistants at 3, 6 and 12\u2005months after discharge and will include: all-cause hospitalisations and cardiac-related hospital readmissions (primary outcome), all-cause mortality including cardiac-related mortality, ED visits including cardiac-related ED visits, adherence to medications and treatment burden. Percentage of readmissions between the 3 arms will be compared on intent-to-treat basis using \u03c7 2 test with Bonferroni's adjusted pairwise comparisons if needed. The study was ethically approved by the Qatar University and the Hamad Medical Corporation Institutional Review Boards. The results shall be disseminated in international conferences and peer-reviewed publications. NCT02648243 ; pre-results."

Emergency medical services (EMS) clinicians may limit their use of intranasal naloxone due to concerns of novel coronavirus infection. We sought to determine changes in overdose events and naloxone administration practices by EMS clinicians. Between April 29, 2020 and May 15, 2020, we surveyed directors of EMS fellowship programs across the US about how overdose events and naloxone administration practices had changed in their catchment areas since March 2020. Based on 60 respondents across all regions of the country, one fifth of surveyed communities have experienced an increase in opioid overdoses and events during which naloxone was administered, and 40% have experienced a decrease. The findings varied by region of the country. Eighteen percent of respondents have discouraged or prohibited the use of intranasal naloxone with 10% encouraging the use of intramuscular naloxone. These findings may provide insight into changes in opioid overdose mortality during this time and assist in future disaster planning."

Perforation due to an ingested foreign body can occur at some point of physiological narrowing or angulation of the intestinal lumen, such as the ileocecal and rectosigmoid junctions. We experienced an unusual case of malignant lymphoma incidentally diagnosed after perforation of the jejunum by a fish bone. In cases of perforation of the jejunum with an ingested foreign body, careful observation during the surgery may be needed in order to avoid missing the accompanying malignancy. The ingestion of a foreign body is relatively common. However, it rarely results in the perforation of gastrointestinal tract. We herein report an unusual case of malignant lymphoma incidentally diagnosed after the perforation of the small intestine by a fish bone. A 90-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of abdominal pain and vomiting. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated free air and ascites in the abdominal cavity. In the pelvic cavity, a radiopaque linear shadow about 35\u00a0mm in diameter was shown in the small intestine, and the stricture was exposed to the abdominal cavity. Therefore, a diagnosis of perforation of the small intestine due to ingestion of a foreign body and panperitonitis was made. Emergent laparotomy was performed. The intraoperative findings revealed perforation of the small intestine with a fish bone in the jejunum. Local inflammation at the perforation site was seen, and circulated wall thickness was observed at the distal side of the jejunum. Partial resection of the jejunum and anastomosis of jejuno-jejunostomy was performed. A pathological examination and immunohistochemical study of the resected specimen resulted in a diagnosis of malignant lymphoma of follicular lymphoma Grade 1. It is very difficult to identify the existence malignancy accompanied with gastrointestinal perforation with ingestion of a foreign body. In cases suspected of involving malignancy, careful observation during surgery is needed in order to avoid missing the accompanying malignancy."

This paper summarises the overall recommendations on future actions and research priorities of the conference and complements the earlier multi\u2010authored papers in this issue. The conference started and closed with the plenary sessions \u2018where science meets society: putting risk assessment in context\u2019 and \u2018staying relevant in a changing world\u2019, respectively. In between, there were seven breakout sessions five of which aimed at advancing risk assessment science in the areas of human health, the environment, biological hazards, nutrition and managing evidence, and two of which were dedicated to the societal aspects of risk assessment: engaging with society and envisioning the expertise of the future. During the 4\u00a0days of the event, participants addressed the complex interplay between science, risk assessment, policy and society, and explored how to advance food safety risk assessment to address the challenges of a changing world and ensure preparedness. Acknowledging that good science alone is no longer sufficient to ensure fit\u2010for\u2010purpose food safety risk assessments, EFSA must further build on its current five Strategic Objectives. To ensure that its risk assessments remain scientifically robust and sound, EFSA should strive for robust and fit\u2010for\u2010purpose risk assessments; consider food in the context of safety, nutrition and sustainability; and explore further how EFSA can work with other organisations to achieve the One Health/One Environment goals. In addition, EFSA should base scientific risk assessments on reliable science while capitalising on scientific advances; address scientific uncertainties; and fully publish the evidence and data used. In line with societal expectations, EFSA , in coordination with risk managers, should frame risk assessments through clear policy goals and problem formulation; be explicit about value judgements; communicate clearly and consistently and in coordination with risk assessors and risk managers; involve society; avoid conflicts of interest; and follow trustworthy processes."

        "abstract": "Astrocytes are intimately involved in the formation and development of retinal vessels. Astrocyte dysfunction is a major cause of blood-retinal barrier injury and other retinal vascular diseases. In this study, the development of the retinal vascular system and the formation of the blood-retinal barrier in mice were investigated using immunofluorescence staining, gelatin-ink perfusion, and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that the retinal vascular system of mice develops from the optic disc after birth, and radiates out gradually to cover the entire retina, taking the papilla optica as the center. First, the superficial vasculature is formed on the inner retinal layer; then, the vasculature extends into the inner and outer edges of the retinal inner nuclear layer, forming the deep vasculature that is parallel to the superficial vasculature. The blood-retinal barrier is mainly composed of endothelium, basal lamina and the end-feet of astrocytes, which become mature during mouse development. Initially, the naive endothelial cells were immature with few organelles and many microvilli. The basal lamina was uniform in thickness, and the glial end-feet surrounded the outer basal lamina incompletely. In the end, the blood-retinal barrier matures with smooth endothelia connected through tight junctions, relatively thin and even basal lamina, and relatively thin glial cell end-feet. These findings indicate that the development of the vasculature in the retina follows the rules of \u201ccenter to periphery\u201d and \u201csuperficial layer to deep layers\u201d. Its development and maturation are spatially and temporally consistent with the functional performance of retinal neurons and photosensitivity. The blood-retinal barrier gradually becomes mature via the process of interactions between astrocytes and blood vessel cells."

In this study, we examined the extent of hybridization in naturalized populations of U. pumila , its impact on genetic diversity and genetic structure and its potential role in explaining the invasion process of U. pumila . Genetic analyses indicated widespread hybridization with native Ulmus rubra in naturalized U. pumila populations. Hybridization increased the genetic diversity of U. pumila populations and affected their genetic structure. The level of genetic diversity in \u2018mature\u2019 accessions, many of which may represent original plantings throughout the USA, was high and similar to the diversity of East Asian accessions. Hybridization with the native red elm may play an important role in the success of Siberian elm as an invader in temperate regions of the USA."

Vietnam has a concentrated HIV epidemic with the highest prevalence among people who inject drugs. We investigated the impact of expanded HIV testing and counseling (HTC) and early ART, combined with other prevention interventions on HIV transmission. A deterministic mathematical model was developed using HIV prevalence trends in Can Tho province, Vietnam. Scenarios included offering periodic HTC and immediate ART with and without targeting subpopulations and examining combined strategies with methadone maintenance therapy and condom use. From 2011 to 2050, maintaining current interventions will incur an estimated 18,115 new HIV infections and will cost US $22.1 million (reference scenario). Annual HTC and immediate treatment, if offered to all adults, will reduce new HIV infections by 14,513 (80%) and will cost US $76.9 million. Annual HTC and immediate treatment offered only to people who inject drugs will reduce new infections by 13,578 (75%) and will cost only US $23.6 million. Annual HTC and immediate treatment for key populations, combined with scale-up of methadone maintenance therapy and condom use, will reduce new infections by 14,723 (81%) with similar costs (US $22.7 million). This combination prevention scenario will reduce the incidence to less than 1 per 100,000 in 14 years and will result in a relative cost saving after 19 years. Targeted periodic HTC and immediate ART combined with other interventions is cost-effective and could lead to potential elimination of HIV in Can Tho."

To date, no published studies have demonstrated that school fruit schemes do prevent overweight. The aim of the present study was to assess if increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, due to free school fruit, have an impact on future weight status. An intervention study including 10- to 12-year-old children from nine schools in two Norwegian counties (Hedmark and Telemark) participating in the Norwegian School Fruit Program for free during the school year 2001/2002 and children from 29 control schools. Follow-up studies were performed in 2005 and 2009. The cohort includes 1950 pupils (984 boys, 966 girls) at baseline, 1,602 participants in 2005 and 320 participants in the 2009 survey, of which 282 also had participated in 2005. In 2005, there was no significant difference between the free fruit group and the control group regarding weight status, Body mass index, or perceived weight status. In 2009, a significant difference in prevalence of overweight was observed (15% vs. 25%, p =0.04). In the crude logistic analysis, the OR for being overweight was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.28\u20130.97) for the intervention group compared to controls. When adjusting for school, sex, grade level and parental education, the association was no longer statistically significant. These results indicate that free school fruit might contribute to prevent future excessive weight gain. However, the study results are limited by low participation rate."

A cross\u2010sectional descriptive study. Pre\u2010piloted scales were used to determine whether they experienced fear of hypoglycaemia and whether this impacted upon their management of the disease. From June\u2013October 2019, participants were asked to complete the \u201chypoglycaemia fear survey\u201d and \u201cdiabetes distress scales\u201d to assess levels of fear and distress. Stepwise multivariate regression analysis was applied to reveal relationship between distress as a dependent variable and fear as a independent variable. Covariates included demographic, clinical or lifestyle factors. A total of 258 participants were recruited for the survey, and they were characterized by little or no distress (39.53%), moderate distress (45.35%) and high distress (15.12%). The prevalence of moderate to severe distress in patients was 60.47%. Increased diabetes\u2010related distress was strongly correlated with increased fear of hypoglycaemia and closely associated with the scores of the worry and behaviour subscales. These results indicated that 62.3% of diabetes\u2010related distress may be explained by fear of hypoglycaemia. Increased diabetes\u2010related distress is associated with increased fear of hypoglycaemia in individuals with type 2 diabetes."

        "abstract": "CCN family member 2 (CCN2), also known as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), has been suggested to be an endochondral ossification genetic factor that has been termed \u201cecogenin\u201d, because in vitro studies revealed that CCN2 promotes the proliferation and differentiation of growth-plate chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and vascular endothelial cells, all of which play important roles in endochondral ossification. In addition to its action toward these three types of cells, CCN2 was recently found to promote the formation of osteoclasts in vitro, which cells play an important role in the replacement of cartilage by bone during endochondral ossification, thus strengthening the \u201cecogenin\u201d hypothesis. For confirmation of this hypothesis, transgenic mice over-expressing CCN2 in cartilage were generated. The results proved the hypothesis; i.e., the over-expression of CCN2 in cartilage stimulated the proliferation and differentiation of growth-plate chondrocytes, resulting in the promotion of endochondral ossification. In addition to its \u201cecogenin\u201d action, CCN2 had earlier been shown to promote the differentiation of various cartilage cells including articular cartilage cells. In accordance with these findings, cartilage-specific overexpression of CCN2 in the transgenic mice was shown to protect against the development of osteoarthritic changes in aging articular cartilage. Thus, CCN2 may also play a role as an anti-aging (chondroprotective) factor, stabilizing articular cartilage. CCN2 also had been shown to promote intramembranous ossification, regenerate cartilage and bone, and induce angiogenesis in vivo. For understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying such multifunctional actions, yeast two-hybrid analysis, protein array analysis, solid-phase binding assay, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis have been used to search for binding partners of CCN2. ECMs such as fibronectin and aggrecan, growth factors including BMPs and FGF2 and their receptors such as FGFR1 and 2 and RANK, as well as CCN family members themselves, were shown to bind to CCN2. Regarding the interaction of CCN2 with some of them, various binding modules in the CCN2 molecule have been identified. Therefore, the numerous biological actions of CCN2 would depend on what kinds of binding partners and what levels of them are present in the microenvironment of different types of cells, as well as on the state of differentiation of these cells. Through this mechanism, CCN2 would orchestrate various signaling pathways, acting as a signal conductor to promote harmonized skeletal growth and regeneration."

Study participants were 74 females treated with denosumab for 24 months. After investigating baseline demographics and overall time course for each patient, we divided all cases into two groups according to percent change (%) in bone mineral density (BMD) of lumbar spine (LS-) and total hip (TH-) at 24 months (-24m); two thirds of the patients were allocated to the good outcome group (LS-GO and TH-GO), and the other third to the non-good outcome group (LS-NG and TH-NG). We performed multivariate analysis to confirm predictors of greater increases in LS- and TH-BMD. LS-BMD-24m and TH-BMD-24m increased significantly from baseline. We observed greater %LS-BMD-24m in LS-GO group than in LS-NG group, while %TH-BMD-24m showed no significant group-dependent difference. N-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (P1NP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)-5b decreased more in LS-GO group than in LS-NG group at each time point. We observed greater %TH-BMD-24m in TH-GO group than in TH-NG group, while %LS-BMD-24m showed no significant group-dependent difference. Only P1NP-6m showed a larger decrease in TH-GO group relative to TH-NG group. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the larger decrease in P1NP-6m was associated with the greater increase in LS-BMD-24m, while the combined use of biologics was associated with the greater increase in TH-BMD-24m. In conclusions, denosumab increased BMD in RA patients with osteoporosis. The combined use of biologics and denosumab may provide useful treatment options."

        "abstract": "To evaluate the impact of age on treatment-related acute morbidity, on modifications of drug doses and radiotherapy and on disease-free and overall survival in non-elderly and elderly with high-risk cervical cancer treated with concurrent radiochemotherapy following laparoscopic surgery. One hundred and two patients with high-risk FIGO I \u2013 IVA cervical cancer (77 non-elderly [<60\u00a0years] and 25 elderly [\u226560\u00a0years]) were treated by radical hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy ( n =\u00a091) and postoperative radiochemotherapy or radical radiochemotherapy alone after laparoscopic lymph node dissection ( n =\u00a011) patients received five to six cycles of cis-platin, 40\u00a0mg/sqm weekly, given concurrently to pelvic radiotherapy of 45\u201350.4\u00a0Gy in 5\u20136\u00a0weeks. Paraaortic radiotherapy with 45\u00a0Gy was performed when laparoscopic staging revealed paraaortic node metastases. Acute morbidity was prospectively scored weekly. Toxicity-related protocol violations (treatment breaks or dose reduction) were related with age, 5-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates. Clinical stages and histologic subtypes were equally distributed. Grade 3/4 leukopenia, anemia, diarrhea and nausea occurred more frequently in the elderly. 16 (22%) non-elderly and 6 (25%) elderly needed a modification of drug dose. 10/77 (13%) non-elderly patients and 11/25 (44%) of the elderly needed an unscheduled treatment break ( p =\u00a00.002). OS and PFS were not different between age groups. The 5-year OS rate was 47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06% for non-elderly patients and 45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010% for the elderly. Patients with/without treatment breaks had a 5-year OS rate of 39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011%/48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06%. The 5-year PFS rate is 49\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06% for non-elderly patients and 47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011% for the elderly. Patients with/without treatment breaks had a 5-year PFS probability of 50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012%/48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06%. FIGO stage retains its prognostic significance irrespective of age. Concurrent radiochemotherapy caused slightly higher acute toxicity with increasing age. Adjustment of treatment intensity was more frequent in the elderly but did not result in detrimental outcome figures."

        "abstract": "Over 8000 new pancreatic cancers are diagnosed annually in the UK; most at an advanced stage, with only 3% 5-year survival. We aimed to identify and quantify the risk of pancreatic cancer for features in primary care. A case\u2013control study using electronic primary care records identified and quantified the features of pancreatic cancer. Cases, aged \u2a7e40 in the General Practice Research Database, UK, with primary pancreatic cancer were matched with controls on age, sex and practice. Putative features of pancreatic cancer were identified in the year before diagnosis. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for features of cancer using conditional logistic regression. Positive predictive values (PPV) were calculated for consulting patients. In all, 3635 cases and 16\u2009459 controls were studied. Nine features were associated with pancreatic cancer (all P <0.001 except for back pain, P =0.004); jaundice, OR 1000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4\u2009302\u2009500); abdominal pain, 5 (4.4, 5.6); nausea/vomiting, 4.5 (3.5, 5.7); back pain, 1.4 (1.1, 1.7); constipation, 2.2 (1.7, 2.8); diarrhoea, 1.9 (1.5, 2.5); weight loss, 15 (11, 22); malaise, 2.4 (1.6, 3.5); new-onset diabetes 2.1 (1.7, 2.5). Positive predictive values for patients aged \u2a7e60 were <1%, apart from jaundice at 22% (95% CI 14, 52), though several pairs of symptoms had PPVs >1%. Most previously reported symptoms of pancreatic cancer were also relevant in primary care. Although predictive values were small \u2013 apart from jaundice \u2013 they provide a basis for selection of patients for investigation, especially with multiple symptoms."

We recently reported that salivary lactoferrin (Lf) could be presented as new biomarker candidate for AD, being both non\u2010invasive and cost\u2010effective, as well as having appropriate diagnostic performance for the clinical detection of AD subjects. Saliva is an attractive sample type for biomarker\u2010based testing approaches for several other diseases; however, its composition may change under certain circumstances. It is therefore critical to maintain a consistent salivary handling protocol, considering possible extrinsic factors that may influence salivary Lf concentration. In this work, we analyzed salivary Lf concentration under different handling conditions and donor\u2010dependent factors including age, inter\u2010diurnal variations, physical activity, and pharmacological treatments. Our aim was to evaluate the influence of such conditions on salivary Lf concentration. In conclusion, we found that most of these extrinsic factors should be considered in the future when using Lf as a predictive biomarker for AD."

        "abstract": "COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped positive sense RNA virus. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and human transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) are essential for the host cell-mediated viral entry. Targeting these proteins represent viable options to stop the first stage of infection and transmission. Hence, 97 alkaloids from African medicinal plants with reported antiviral activity were evaluated for this purpose via in silico studies. These alkaloids were docked for their interactions with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, ACE2, and TMPRSS2. Top 20 alkaloids with highest binding affinities were further screened for their interactions with spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and with ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain complex (ACE2-RBD). The energy profiling, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS), binding free energy base on Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MMGBSA), clustering of MDS trajectories, and virtual physicochemical and pharmacokinetic screening of the best docked alkaloids were performed. Results revealed that more than 15 alkaloids interacted better than the reference compounds. 10\u2013Hydroxyusambarensine and Cryptospirolepine were docked in a similar binding pattern to the S1-specificy pocket of TMPRSS2 as camostat (reference inhibitor). The strong binding affinities, stability of the alkaloid-protein complexes and amino acid interactions displayed by cryptospirolepine, 10-hydroxyusambarensine, and cryptoquindoline with important binding hotspots of the proteins suggest these alkaloids have the potential of altering the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 membrane mediated host cell entry. Further in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo evaluation of these \u201cdrug-like\u201d alkaloids as potential inhibitors of coronavirus cell entry is proposed. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma"

The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was performed, after 48 h treatments with different concentrations of extracts, to determine their concentration of the extract or Dox that inhibits cell viability by 50% for each cell line. The effects of the crude extracts on DNA damage, clonogenic potential and their ability to induce cell death were also assessed. E1 was found to the void of anti-proliferative effects. E2 was shown to decrease the clonogenic potential in human colorectal carcinoma cell line (HCT116), human malignant melanoma cell line (A375), human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF7), and human caucasian colon adenocarcinoma Grade II cell line (HT29) cells, whereas E3 showed such effect only in HCT116 and MCF7 cells. Both extracts were found to increase DNA damage in some cell lines. E2 was found to induce cell death in HT29, HCT116, MCF7, and A375 cells while extract E3 increased cell death in MCF7 and HCT116 cell lines. The results reveal that E2 and E3 possess anticancer activities in human colon carcinoma, breast adenocarcinoma, and melanoma cells, validating the interest for an identification of molecular targets involved in the anticancer activity.  The crude ethyl acetate extract of N. tsunodae (E1) did not decrease cell viability in any of the tested cell lines The crude ethyl acetate extracts of N. laciniosa (E2) and N. fischeri (E3) decreased cell proliferation in some human cancer cell lines tested at both short- and long-term N. laciniosa (E2) induced a significant increase in the number of cell death, in part, due to the induction of DNA damage N. fischeri (E3) induce cell death but in some cell lines without induction of DNA damage detected by comet assay Crude ethyl extracts of N. laciniosa (E2) and N. fischeri (E3) exert an anticancer activity in human colon carcinoma, breast adenocarcinoma, and malignant melanoma cells.

As the Europeans were entering the Southwestern states of the USA, Athabaskan hunting-gathering tribes were migrating South from Canada along the Rocky Mountains and undergoing potential bottlenecks reflected in autosomal recessive diseases shared by Apaches and Navajos. About 300\u00a0years ago, the Navajo developing a sedentary culture learned from Pueblo Indians while the Apache remained hunter-gathers. Although most of the tribe was rounded up and forced to relocate to Bosque Redondo, the adult breeding population was large enough to prevent a genetic bottleneck. However, some Navajo underwent further population bottlenecks while hiding from the brutal US Army action (under Kit Carson\u2019s guidance). This led to an increased frequency of other autosomal recessive diseases. Recent advances in population genetics, pathophysiology of the diseases, and social/ethical issues concerning their study are reviewed."

A nonconcurrent cohort study with passive follow-up was conducted using a probabilistic linkage method to analyze a sample of patients diagnosed and reported as having TB in 2006 and followed up until 2008. New cases, cases with previous treatment (readmission after loss to follow-up or relapse), and transfers across health services were included. Proportional hazards models were used to estimate the independent effect of covariates related to the individual and to the health services on mortality from all causes. Age above 60 years, admission to a hospital with emergency services, HIV-associated TB, and readmission to an outpatient facility after disease relapse or loss to follow-up were identified as risk factors for death. Variables related to process and results indicators of Brazil's National TB Program were not associated with mortality from all causes. Advanced age, previous treatment for TB, and treatment at a secondary-level outpatient facility or a hospital with emergency services on site were associated with mortality in TB patients. Better strategies to improve TB care delivered at health units are needed to prevent death from TB, especially among the elderly."

        "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the antiviral role of nucleic acid-based agonists for the activation of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways, and its protective role in respiratory influenza A virus infections. TLR-3 is expressed on myeloid dendritic cells, respiratory epithelium, and macrophages, and appears to play a central role in mediating both the antiviral and inflammatory responses of the innate immunity in combating viral infections. Influenza viruses can effectively inhibit the host's ability to produce interferons, and thereby suppress the immune system's antiviral defence mechanisms. Poly ICLC is a synthetic double stranded RNA comprising of polyriboinosinic-poly ribocytidylic acid (Poly IC) stabilized with l -lysine (L) and carboxymethylcellulose (C). Poly ICLC and liposome-encapsulated Poly ICLC (LE Poly ICLC) are TLR-3 agonists and are potent inducer of interferons and natural killer cells. Intranasal pre-treatment of mice with Poly ICLC and LE Poly ICLC provided high level of protection against lethal challenge with a highly lethal avian H5N1 influenza (HPAI) strain (A/H5N1/chicken/Henan clade 2), and against lethal seasonal influenza A/PR/8/34 [H1N1] and A/Aichi/2 [H3N2] virus strains. The duration of protective antiviral immunity to multiple lethal doses of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 virus had been previously found to persist for up to 3 weeks in mice for LE Poly ICLC and 2 weeks for Poly ICLC. Similarly, pre-treatment of mice with CpG oligonucleotides (TLR-9 agonist) was also found to provide complete protection against influenza A/PR/8/34 infection in mice. RT-PCR analysis of lung tissues of mice treated with Poly ICLC and LE Poly ICLC revealed upregulation of TLR-3 mRNAs gene expression. Taken together, these results do support the potential role of TLR-3 and TLR-9 agonists such as Poly ICLC and LE Poly ICLC in protection against lethal seasonal and HPAI virus infection."

Therefore, we investigated the characteristics of age-related VFF and their correlation with bone mineral density (BMD). Furthermore, we analyzed other factors affecting VFF Medical records from a single center were retrospectively reviewed for 2,216 patients over 50 years old with vertebral fractures conservatively treated from 2005 to 2016. Patients' age, gender, body mass index (BMI), BMD, fracture level, previous vertebral fractures, and anti-osteoporosis medications were obtained. Patients were divided into fragility/non-fragility groups and age sub-groups. The odds ratio for VFF in relation to BMD was evaluated. We also identified other predictive factors for VFF by age groups. The fragility group had a higher women ratio, older age, lower BMI, lower BMD, and greater incidence of previous vertebral fractures than the non-fragility group. VFFs were seen in 41.18% of normal BMD patients aged 50\u201359 and 67.82% of those aged 60\u201369. The proportion of VFFs increased with age in all WHO osteoporosis classifications. Patients with osteopenia and osteoporosis were 1.57 and 2.62 fold more likely to develop VFFs than normal BMD. In the younger group (under 70), age, women, BMD, and previous vertebral fracture were significant factors affecting VFF, and in the older group (70 and over), age, women, and BMD were factors. In the fragility group, anti-osteoporosis medication rates were 25.08% before and 45.96% after fracture. Considerable VFFs occurred in the younger age groups without osteoporosis and age itself was another important predictor of VFF especially in older age groups. The discrepancy between the incidence of VFF and BMD suggests the necessity of supplemental screening factors and anti-osteoporosis treatment guidelines using only BMD should be reconsidered."

Patients with synchronous or metachronous PM who underwent cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with HIPEC were systematically reviewed at the China National Cancer Center and Huanxing Cancer Hospital from June 2017 to June 2019. All enrolled patients were grouped into either lobaplatin or nonlobaplatin groups depending on the different chemotherapeutic agents used during HIPEC. Clinical characteristics, pathological features, perioperative parameters, and prognostic data were collected and analyzed. A total of 100 patients were enrolled, with 48 patients in the lobaplatin group and 52 in the nonlobaplatin group. The two groups were well balanced in terms of clinicopathological characteristics. The two groups had comparable perioperative outcomes. However, more patients in the lobaplatin group than in the nonlobaplatin group developed abnormal platelet levels on postoperative day (POD)3 and abnormal ALT levels on POD5. Moreover, the average platelet count in the lobaplatin group was significantly lower than that in the nonlobaplatin group on POD5. There were no significant differences in the 3-year overall survival (OS) rates (48.4% vs 35.1%, P =0.298) and the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates (34.9% vs 21.0%, P =0.470) of the two groups. Lobaplatin-based HIPEC is safe and feasible for the treatment of patients with PM arising from colorectal or appendiceal cancer with comparable low mortality and acceptable morbidity."

We report here an affinity purification system named the \u2018GRP system\u2019, which uses the association between the \u03b2-1,3-glucan recognition domain of \u03b2GRP (GRP-tag), as an affinity tag, and curdlan beads. Curdlan is a water-insoluble \u03b2-1,3-glucan reagent, the low cost of which (about 100 JPY/g) allows the economical preparation of beads. Curdlan beads can be readily prepared by solubilization in an alkaline solution, followed by neutralization, sonication and centrifugation. We applied the GRP system to preparation of several proteins and revealed that the expression levels of the GRP-tagged proteins in soluble fractions were two or three times higher than those of the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged proteins. The purity of the GRP-tagged proteins on the curdlan beads was comparable to that of the GST-tagged proteins on glutathione beads. The chemical stability of the GRP system was more robust than conventional affinity systems under various conditions, including low pH (4\u20136). Biochemical and structural analyses revealed that proteins produced using the GRP system were structurally and functionally active. Thus, the GRP system is suitable for both the large- and small-scale preparation of recombinant proteins for functional and structural analyses."

        "abstract": "The oncocytic variant of prostatic adenocarcinoma is exceptionally rare with only 4 cases reported in the English literature. Little is known about the clinical behavior of this variant of prostatic adenocarcinoma, because of the exceptionally low number of reported cases. The 2016 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of Prostate does not recognize the oncocytic variant, again likely related to the exceptional paucity of reported cases. Here, we report the fifth case of the oncocytic variant of acinar type prostatic adenocarcinoma in an asymptomatic 64-year-old Caucasian American male with elevated serum prostate specific antigen (7.33 ng/mL; normal range 0-4.00 ng/mL) during routine blood screening for diabetes mellitus. At subsequent transrectal prostate biopsy, the right side of prostate was infiltrated by adenocarcinoma with tumor cells forming variably differentiated glands, including some poorly differentiated. Tumor cell nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio was low, with small to intermediate sized vesicular nuclei and only rare discernable small nucleoli. Cellular cytoplasm was characteristically granular pink with sharply defined cell membranes. Positive AMACR (P504S) epithelial immunohistochemical staining and absence of staining for prostatic basal cells confirmed the tumor to be primary prostatic adenocarcinoma. AMACR immunohistochemical staining was also helpful with accurate grading of the tumor due to the difficulty of differentiating tumor cells from residual prostate myocytes at routine hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. This new case adds to the exceptionally small number of previously reported cases of the oncocytic variant of primary prostatic adenocarcinoma. It also highlights the difficulty associated with Gleason scoring of the oncocytic variant by routine HE evaluation and the usefulness of AMACR (P504S) immunostaining for accurate grading of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the oncocytic variant."

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, which started around December 2019 has, at present, resulted in over 450,000 deaths globally, and approximately 1% of these deaths have been reported in Africa. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 risk factors, namely: hypertension, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as rheumatic heart disease, compromised immunity and obesity, low case fatality rates have been recorded in many parts of Africa so far. COVID-19 severity has previously been shown to be worse in patients with CVD and hypertension. We observed the severity of COVID-19 and mortality rates in Africa, and compared outcomes with prevalence of established risk factors (hypertension and CVD). We stratified data as per the United Nations\u2019 5 African subregions. North African countries show a positive association between the risk factors and the mortality rates from COVID-19. However, we observed discordant patterns in the relationship between COVID-19, and either CVD or hypertension, in sub-Saharan African countries. In this paper, we also review the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and how it worsens CVD and postulate that the differences in modulation of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) axis which controls angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)/ACE2 balance may be an important determinant of COVID-19 outcomes in Africa.

The prevalence of tumoral transformation is 0.7-1.6% and the most common tumors are clear cell and endometrioid carcinomas. Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of transformation is unknown. For this purpose, we examined molecular alterations in ovarian endometriosis and endometriosis-associated tumors. Using the data bank of Alzahra hospital pathology department and paraffin blocks from appropriate cases were identified. Sections were cut and stained for 3 markers: estrogen receptor, P53 and bcl2. Correlations between findings were investigated. Nineteen cases of endometriosis-associated tumor and 19 cases of endometriosis were identified. Staining for bcl2 was documented in 14 of 19 (73.7%) of endometriosis-associated tumor cases and also 7 of 19 (36.8%) endometriosis cases (P=0.02). Only 3 of the 19 (15.8%) endometriosis-associated tumors exhibited positive staining for estrogen receptors, compared with 14 of 19 (73.7%) endometriosis cases (P<0.001). Positive staining for P53 was noted in 5 of 19 (31.6%) endometriosis-associated ovarian tumor samples but was absent in endometriosis samples (0%), (P =0.008). Endometriosis-associated tumors appear to be associated with overexpression of bcl2 and P53 and reduced expression of Estrogen receptor. These finding may help to diagnose tumoral transformation with a background of endometriosis."

The influence of HIF-1\u03b1 for the development of cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac function that occurs in response to sustained pressure overload has been mainly attributed to a challenged cardiac angiogenesis and cardiac hypertrophy up to now. Hif-1\u03b1  +/+ and Hif-1\u03b1  +/\u2212 mice were studied regarding left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac function after being subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC). After TAC, both Hif-1\u03b1  +/+ and Hif-1\u03b1  +/\u2212 mice developed left ventricular hypertrophy with increased posterior wall thickness, septum thickness and increased left ventricular weight to a similar extent. No significant difference in cardiac vessel density was observed between Hif-1\u03b1  +/+ and Hif-1\u03b1  +/\u2212 mice. However, only the Hif-1\u03b1  +/\u2212 mice developed severe heart failure as revealed by a significantly reduced fractional shortening mostly due to increased end-systolic left ventricular diameter. On the single cell level this correlated with reduced myocyte shortenings, decreased intracellular Ca 2+ -transients and SR-Ca 2+ content in myocytes of Hif-1a  +/\u2212 mice. Thus, HIF-1\u03b1 can be critically involved in the preservation of cardiac function after chronic pressure overload without affecting cardiac hypertrophy. This effect is mediated via HIF-dependent modulation of cardiac calcium handling and contractility.

        "abstract": "Deletion or mutation of dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) leads to hypophosphatemic rickets and defects within the dentin. However, it is largely unknown if this pathological change is a direct role of DMP1 or an indirect role of phosphate (Pi) or both. It has also been previously shown that Klotho- deficient mice, which displayed a high Pi level due to a failure of Pi excretion, causes mild defects in the dentinal structure. This study was to address the distinct roles of DMP1 and Pi homeostasis in cell differentiation, apoptosis and mineralization of dentin and enamel. Our working hypothesis was that a stable Pi homeostasis is critical for postnatal tooth formation, and that DMP1 has an antiapoptotic role in both amelogenesis and dentinogenesis. To test this hypothesis, Dmp1 -null ( Dmp1 \u2212/\u2212 ), Klotho -deficient ( kl/kl ), Dmp1/Klotho -double-deficient ( Dmp1 \u2212/\u2212 /kl/kl ) and wild-type (WT) mice were killed at the age of 6 weeks. Combinations of X-ray, microcomputed tomography (\u03bcCT), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), histology, apoptosis and immunohistochemical methods were used for characterization of dentin, enamel and pulp structures in these mutant mice. Our results showed that Dmp1 \u2212/\u2212 (a low Pi level) or kl/kl (a high Pi level) mice displayed mild dentin defects such as thin dentin and a reduction of dentin tubules. Neither deficient mouse line exhibited any apparent changes in enamel or pulp structure. However, the double-deficient mice (a high Pi level) displayed severe defects in dentin and enamel structures, including loss of dentinal tubules and enamel prisms, as well as unexpected ectopic ossification within the pulp root canal. TUNEL assay showed a sharp increase in apoptotic cells in ameloblasts and odontoblasts. Based on the above findings, we conclude that DMP1 has a protective role for odontoblasts and ameloblasts in a pro-apoptotic environment (a high Pi level)."

The etiology of colitis cases can be manifold, and diet can significantly affect onset and outcome of colitis. While many forms of acute colitis are easily treatable, chronic forms of colitis such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease (summarized as inflammatory bowel diseases) are multifactorial with poorly understood pathogenesis. Inflammatory bowel diseases are characterized by exacerbated immune responses causing epithelial dysfunction and bacterial translocation. There is no cure and therapies aim at reducing inflammation and restoring intestinal barrier function. Unfortunately, most drugs can have severe side effects. Changes in diet and inclusion of nutritional supplements have been extensively studied in cell culture and animal models, and some supplements have shown promising results in clinical studies. Most of these nutritional supplements including vitamins, fatty acids and phytochemicals reduce oxidative stress and inflammation and have shown beneficial effects during experimental colitis in rodents induced by dextran sulphate sodium or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, which remain the gold standard in pre-clinical colitis research. Here, we summarize the mechanisms through which such nutritional supplements contribute to epithelial barrier stabilization."

Patients were assigned to adrenalectomy (n\u00a0= 438) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist (n\u00a0= 746) groups. We assessed associations between changes in blood pressure (BP), plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentrations (PAC), and eGFR before and 6 months after treatment for both groups. In a multivariable linear regression, the adjusted \u03b2 values (95% confidence interval [CI]) for change in eGFR after treatment were\u00a0\u22122.76 (\u22124.29,\u00a0\u22121.22) ml/min per 1.73 m 2 for PRA (per 3.2 ng/ml per hour), and 1.97 (1.08, 2.85) ml/min per 1.73 m 2 for PAC (per 236.1 pg/ml) in the adrenalectomy group; and\u00a0\u22120.45 (\u22120.89,\u00a0\u22120.01) ml/min per 1.73 m 2 for PRA and\u00a0\u22120.72 (\u22121.62, 0.18) ml/min per 1.73 m 2 for PAC in the MR antagonist group. Change in mean arterial pressure after treatment was not significantly associated with change in eGFR in either group. Changes in PRA and PAC but not BP before and 6 months after treatment for PA were associated with greater reductions in eGFR. Post-treatment improvements in glomerular hyperfiltration may be attributable to decreased MR activity in the kidneys, but not to reductions in systemic BP."

Iron alloys have been shown to be good candidates for biomedical applications where load support is required. Fe\u2013Mn alloys were researched extensively for this purpose. Current research shows that all metallurgical characterisation and corrosion test on Fe\u2013Mn and Fe\u2013Mn\u2013Ag non pre-alloyed powder alloys are performed on alloys which are initially pressed into greens and subsequently sintered. In order to combine the cutting-edge field of biodegradable metallic alloys with scaffold production, metallurgical characterisation of pressed and non-pressed Fe, Fe\u2013Mn and Fe\u2013Mn\u2013Ag sintered elemental powder compacts was carried out in this study. This was performed along with determination of the corrosion rate of the same alloys in in vitro mimicking solutions. These solutions were synthesised to mimic the osteo environment in which the final scaffolds are to be used. Both pressed and non-pressed alloys formed an austenite phase under the right sintering conditions. The corrosion rate of the non-pressed alloy was greater than that of its pressed counterpart. In a potentiodynamic testing scenario, addition of silver to the alloy formed a separate silver phase which galvanically increased the corrosion rate of the pressed alloy . This result wasn't replicated in the non-pressed alloys in which the corrosion rate was seen to remain similar to the non-silver-bearing alloy counterparts."

Recent community sequencing work has now shown that the bacterial community in the CF lung is polymicrobial. Identifying bacteria in the CF lung through sequencing can be costly and is not practical for many laboratories. Molecular techniques such as terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism or amplicon length heterogeneity-polymerase chain reaction (LH-PCR) can provide many laboratories with the ability to study CF bacterial communities without costly sequencing. The aim of this study was to determine if the use of LH-PCR with multiple hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene could be used to identify organisms found in sputum DNA. This work also determined if LH-PCR could be used to observe the dynamics of lung infections over a period of time. Nineteen samples were analysed with the V1 and the V1_V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Based on the amplicon size present in the V1_V2 region, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was confirmed to be in all 19 samples obtained from the patients. The V1 region provided a higher power of discrimination between bacterial profiles of patients. Both regions were able to identify trends in the bacterial population over a period of time. LH profiles showed that the CF lung community is dynamic and that changes in the community may in part be driven by the patient's antibiotic treatment. LH-PCR is a tool that is well suited for studying bacterial communities and their dynamics."

Three randomized phase 3 designs are porposed for the development of these 4th generation ALK TKIs. Our current treatment paradigm of advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion ( ALK+ ) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) classifies the six currently approved ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) into three generations. The 2nd-generation (2G) and 3rd-generation (3G) ALK TKIs are all \u201csingle mutant active\u201d with varying potencies across a wide spectrum of acquired single ALK resistance mutations. There is a vigorous debate among clinicians which is the best upfront ALK TKI is for the first-line (1L) treatment of ALK + NSCLC and the subsequent sequencing strategies whether it should be based on the presence of specific on-target ALK resistance mutations or not. Regardless, sequential use of \u201csingle mutant active\u201d ALK TKIs will eventually lead to double ALK resistance mutations in cis . This has led to the creation of fourth generation (4G) \u201cdouble mutant active\u201d ALK TKIs such as TPX-0131 and NVL-655. We discuss the critical properties 4G ALK TKIs must possess to be clinically successful. We proposed conceptual first-line, second-line, and molecularly-based third-line registrational randomized clinical trials designed for these 4G ALK TKIs. How these 4G ALK TKIs would be used in the future will depend on which line of treatment the clinical trial design(s) is adopted provided the trial is positive. If approved, 4G ALK TKIs may usher in a new treatment paradigm for advanced ALK+ NSCLC that is based on classifying ALK TKIs based on the intrinsic functional capabilities (\u201csinge mutant active\u201d versus \u201cdouble mutant active\u201d) rather than the loosely-defined \u201cgenerational\u201d (first-, second-,third-,fourth-) classification and avoid the current clinical approaches of seemingly random sequential use of 2G and 3G ALK TKIs.

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of the presence of different chelators in root canals during preparation on the amount of apically extruded debris and to investigate the effect of surface tension of irrigant on the apical extrusion. Ninety extracted mandibular incisor teeth were included. Prior to canal preparation, the teeth were mounted to Eppendorf tubes. Root canals of the samples were prepared with Reciproc instruments in the presence of different chelating agents (17% EDTA-liquid, 17% EDTA-gel, 7% maleic acid, 2.25% peracetic acid, 10% citric acid) and 5% NaOCl. Apically extruded debris was collected in Eppendorf tubes and weighted with an electronic balance. The surface tension of solutions was calculated with the ring method using a du No\u00fcy ring digital tensiometer. The statistical analysis was performed with Tamhane's T2 test for apical extrusion and the Tukey for surface tension. The correlation between apical extrusion and surface tension was compared using Pearson's coefficient. The least amount of apically extruded debris was with EDTA-gel, peracetic acid and citric acid which were similar to each other. NaOCl had the highest surface tension whereas peracetic acid and EDTA-liquid had the lowest. There was no significant correlation exists between apical extrusion and surface tension. The presence of EDTA-gel, citric acid and peracetic acid in root canals during preparation decreased the amount of apically extruded debris compared to other solutions. The investigated irrigation solutions have no significant effect on the amount of apical debris extrusion."

        "abstract": "The optimal route and dosing regimen of tranexamic acid (TXA) in primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remain unclear. As such, we sought to analyze if there was a synergistic effect of intravenous (IV) and topical TXA on blood loss and transfusions. We retrospectively analyzed 6720 primary TKAs and 6559 THAs performed from February 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019 at a single institution in patients who received a double IV dose (6159 TKAs and 6276 THAs) compared with a combined single IV and topical dose (561 TKAs and 283 THAs) of TXA. Multivariate logistic regression models, adjusting for age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, preoperative hemoglobin, and TXA administration, were performed for significant variables from a univariate analysis. In the TKA cohort, the mean total blood loss was statistically similar for double IV (305 mL, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0= 301-310 mL) TXA compared with combined TXA (310 mL, 95% CI\u00a0= 299-321 mL) ( P = .43). Furthermore, there was no difference in the rate of transfusion (odds ratio\u00a0= 1.23, 95% CI\u00a0= 0.57-2.67, P = .598). In the THA cohort, there was statistically higher blood loss with double IV (328 mL, 95% CI\u00a0= 323-333 mL) TXA than in the combined group (295 mL, 95% CI\u00a0= 280-310 mL) ( P < .001). The rate of transfusion was statistically similar at ~2% ( P = .970). A double IV TXA dose and a combined single IV and topical TXA dose were equally effective in minimizing blood transfusions (~2%) at primary TKA and THA. We did not find a synergistic effect when combining a systemic IV TXA with a topical TXA. Level III."

        "abstract": "Thyroid cancer (TC) is an important common endocrine malignancy, and its incidence has increased in the past decades. The current TC diagnosis and classification tools are fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and histological examination following thyroidectomy. The metabolite profile alterations of thyroid cells (oncometabolites) can be considered for current TC diagnosis and management protocols. This systematic review focuses on metabolite alterations within the plasma, FNA specimens, and tissue of malignant TC contrary to benign, goiter, or healthy TC samples. A systematic search of MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science databases was conducted, and the final 31 studies investigating metabolite biomarkers of TC were included. A total of 15 targeted studies and 16 untargeted studies revealed several potential metabolite signatures of TC such as glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, 2-keto- d -gluconic acid and rhamnose, malonic acid and inosine, cholesterol and arachidonic acid, glycosylation (immunoglobulin G [IgG] Fc-glycosylation), outer mitochondrial membrane 20 (TOMM20), monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), choline, choline derivatives, myo-/scyllo-inositol, lactate, fatty acids, several amino acids, cell membrane phospholipids, estrogen metabolites such as 16 alpha-OH E1/2-OH E1 and catechol estrogens (2-OH E1), and purine and pyrimidine metabolites, which were suggested as the TC oncometabolite. Citrate was suggested as the first most significant biomarker and lactate as the second one. Further research is needed to confirm these biomarkers as the TC diagnostic oncometabolite."

However, clinical application of urinary NVs has not yet been validated. In the present study, the levels of mRNAs in urinary NVs in animal models of kidney disease were assessed. Urine samples were collected from the animal models and urinary NVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Gene expression levels of kidney injury markers in urinary NVs and renal tissue were quantified by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. The mRNA levels of desmin, a podocyte injury marker, in urinary NVs was markedly increased in the puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephritis model, in parallel with enhanced desmin expression in kidney tissues. The expression of regulator of calcineurin 1 and the podocin to nephrin ratio (PNR) were also increased in the PAN nephritis model. Treatment with prednisolone mitigated these changes in gene expression as well as proteinuria. PNR, which is considered a predictive marker of glomerular dysfunction, in urinary NVs was highly correlated with urinary protein excretion (P<0.01). Furthermore, PNR in urinary NVs of Zucker diabetic fatty rats, a diabetic kidney disease model, was correlated with urinary albumin excretion (P<0.01). These results suggest that changes in mRNA levels of urinary NVs reflect the disease status of kidney tissues and their functional alterations. Collectively, mRNA analysis of urinary NVs may be used as a liquid biopsy tool for improved classification and performance of risk prediction to determine the severity of kidney diseases."

        "abstract": "Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are widely used for the treatment of depression and anxious disorders. The observation that depression is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with ischemic heart disease, the assessment of the central role of serotonin in pathophysiological mechanisms of depression, and reports of cases of abnormal bleeding associated with antidepressant therapy have led to investigations of the influence of antidepressants on hemostasis markers. In this review, we summarize data regarding modifications of these markers, drawn from clinical studies and case reports. We observed an association between the type of antidepressant drug and the number of abnormal bleeding case reports, with or without modifications of hemostasis markers. Drugs with the highest degree of serotonin reuptake inhibition - fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline - are more frequently associated with abnormal bleeding and modifications of hemostasis markers. The most frequent hemostatic abnormalities are decreased platelet aggregability and activity, and prolongation of bleeding time. Patients with a history of coagulation disorders, especially suspected or documented thrombocytopenia or platelet disorder, should be monitored in case of prescription of any serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI). Platelet dysfunction, coagulation disorder, and von Willebrand disease should be sought in any case of abnormal bleeding occurring during treatment with an SRI. Also, a non-SSRI antidepressant should be favored over an SSRI or an SRI in such a context. Considering the difficulty in performing platelet aggregation tests, which are the most sensitive in SRI-associated bleeding, and the low sensitivity of hemostasis tests when performed in case of uncomplicated bleeding in the general population, establishing guidelines for the assessment of SRI-associated bleeding complications remains a challenge."

Recently, the presence of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators in synovial tissues from patients with osteoarthritis has been reported. To clarify the quantitative and qualitative changes in lipid mediators in the synovium of severe rheumatoid arthritis patients, we compared the profiles of lipid mediators in synovial fluid obtained from patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis and from those with severe osteoarthritis. We enrolled 18 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 26 patients with osteoarthritis. All the patients had undergone total knee replacement surgery. Synovial fluid samples had been obtained during the surgery. Lipid profiling in the synovial fluid from these patients was performed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. Among the 150 oxidized fatty acids examined so far, 119 were substantially detected in synovial fluid from the patients. Not only the concentrations of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, but also those of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators such as lipoxins, resolvins, and protectin D1 were significantly higher in synovial fluid obtained from rheumatoid arthritis patients than from synovial fluid obtained from osteoarthritis patients. The activation of both inflammation and resolution pathways of lipid mediators might be a fatty acid signature in the synovial fluid of patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis. Inflammatory, anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediators in synovial fluid could be good biomarkers for differentiating between severe rheumatoid arthritis and severe osteoarthritis."

        "abstract": "The polyelectrolyte Complexes (PECs) are based on ionic cross-linking. They have been employed to prepare a sustained release matrix tablets. These systems are based upon the fact that their structure can entrap the drug within them. Isosorbide Mononitrate (ISMN) is an anti-anginal organic nitrate vasodilator used in the treatment of various cardiovascular disorders and prophylaxis of angina Pectoris, which is poorly absorbed from the upper GIT, hence CR formulation is desirable. Chitosan (CH)/Sodium alginate (SA), Guar gum (GG), and Xanthan gum (XG) were used as PECs, and were prepared using different proportions i.e., in 1:1 and 1:2 ratio. The optimum ratio of CH: SA, CH: GG and CH: XG was in the ratio was 1:2; these are formed due to electrostatic interaction between oppositely charged poly ions. These normally employ a hydrophilic matrix system. Matrix tablet of ISMN was formulated by using PECs as matrix forming agent by wet granulation technique. The tablets were evaluated for hardness, wt variation, drug content, and in-vitro dissolution studies and found to be within limits. Release kinetics data indicated that ISMN released from the PECs-based matrix tablets of CH-SA, CH-GG and CH-XG CP in 1:1 and 1:2 ratio, followed Fickian and non-Fickian diffusion mechanism respectively. Thus, the drug release rate was extended for over a period of more than 12 h stability studies. There is no significant difference in the mean % drug released from formulation CH-X 2 after storing for 3 months at 40\u00b0C/75% RH. The FT-IR spectra revealed that there was no interaction between polymers and drug, Statistical analysis showed a significant differences ( P < 0.05) for the amount of ISMN released from the formulations (MXG) and formulations (CH-X 2 ). Formulation CH-XG 2 (1:2) showed better sustained release of highly water-soluble ISMN with the desired release rate. Thus, the formulated PECs-based matrix tablets seems to be a potential candidate for sustained drug delivery of highly soluble drug ISMN in the symptomatic therapy of angina pectoris."

Perceived courtesy stigma refers to the perception of stigma of people who are associated with COVID-19 (e.g., the geographic linkage). Affiliate stigma is the internalization and psychological responses of perceived courtesy stigma among the associates. The current study aims to reveal different patterns of perceived courtesy and affiliate stigma among people who are at high risk of contagion of COVID-19, and to examine the possible risk factors. A sample including 2813 adults who located in Hubei Province, China (female: n\u00a0=\u00a02,184, 77.64%; male: n\u00a0=\u00a0629, 22.36%; mean age\u00a0=\u00a037.85 years, SD\u00a0=\u00a06.61 years, range\u00a0=\u00a018\u201363 years) were employed in the current study, using latent profile analysis for searching stigma profiles.

Our findings highlight the issues of COVID-19-related stigma and provide evidence for launching effective health actions to promote a cohesive society and culture of health. The media can transmit scientific knowledge, promote positive interactions and social cohesion between the stigmatized group and the dominant group, and create spaces for stories that nurture group identification among the implicated people.

It has some limitations such as toxic, high density, nonflexibility, and also bremsstrahlung production during electron interaction. It may affect the accuracy of radiotherapy outcome. To theoretically analyze the radiation shielding properties of flexible polyvinyl alcohol/iron oxide polymer composite with five different concentrations of magnetite over the energy range of 15 KeV\u201320 MeV. Radiological properties were calculated based on the published literature. Attenuation coefficients of pure elements are generated with the help of WinXCOM database. Effective atomic numbers and electron density are increased with the concentration of magnetite. On the other hand, the number of electrons per gram decreased. Mass attenuation coefficient (\u03bc/\u03fc) and linear attenuation coefficients (\u03bc) are higher in the lower energy <100 KeV, and their values decreased when the energy increased. Computed tomography numbers (CT) show the significant variation between the concentrations in <60 KeV. Half-value layer and tenth-value layers are directly proportional to the energy and indirectly proportional to the concentration of magnetite. Transmission curve, relaxation length (\u019b), kinetic energy released in the matter, and elemental weight fraction are also calculated and the results are discussed. 0.5% of the magnetite gives superior shielding properties compared with other concentrations. It may be due to the presence of 0.3617% of Fe. Elemental weight fraction, atomic number, photon energy, and mass densities are the important parameters to understand the shielding behavior of any material."

However, it can cause exacerbated toxicities in patients and consequently change the course of treatment. Some factors may interfere with this toxicity such as body composition, especially in gastrointestinal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of body composition, nutritional status, and functional capacity scale in predicting the occurrence of toxicities in gastrointestinal cancer patients during chemotherapy treatment. This is a prospective study with gastrointestinal cancer patients at the beginning of chemotherapy treatment. Sarcopenia and muscle attenuation were assessed using the skeletal muscle index from computerized tomography by measuring cross\u2010sectional areas of the L3 tissue (cm 2 /m 2 ). Cachexia was graded according to involuntary weight loss associated with sarcopenia. Nutritional status was assessed by using anthropometric evaluation and Patient\u2010Generated Subjective Global Assessment. Functional capacity was evaluated by handgrip strength and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status scale. Haematological gastrointestinal and dose\u2010limiting toxicities (DLTs) were defined according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria. The associations among sarcopenia, cachexia, nutritional status, and functional capacity with DLT were assessed by univariate and multivariate Cox regression model. A total of 60 patients were evaluated (55% male, 60.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.0\u00a0years) and followed up for a mean of 55\u00a0days. Most patients had normal weight (44.2%) and good ECOG Performance Status (\u22641) at baseline (78%). During the chemotherapy period, the most prevalent toxicities were diarrhoea, nausea, and anorexia, but the presence of DLT was similar between cycles ( P >\u00a00.05). Cachexia was associated with a higher toxicity manifested by diarrhoea ( P =\u00a00.02), nausea ( P =\u00a00.02), and anorexia ( P <\u00a00.01 and P =\u00a00.03 at Cycles 1 and 2, respectively). Sarcopenic and cachetic individuals experienced more toxicities and DLT during chemotherapy. The only factors associated with DLT in the multivariate Cox regression analyses including the presence of metastasis and the chemotherapy protocol were cachexia and the ECOG scale ( P <\u00a00.001 for both). Cachexia and ECOG score may identify patients with an increased risk for developing severe toxicity events during chemotherapy treatment for gastrointestinal cancer."

With the onset of COVID-19 it is paramount to monitor these activities at home and practice good hygiene. To help stop the spread of disease, we have developed a wireless sensing system capable of detecting voluntary coughs, sneezes, and face touching with alert based notifications sent to a mobile application. Our system uses radio frequency technology to capture motion, speed, direction, and range information from human activities. It does this by using a combination of a continuous wave Doppler and frequency modulated continuous wave radar. By observing a set of features related to the sensed motion, we designed a set of fuzzy logic IF-THEN rules that can differentiate each activity from each other with an overall accuracy of 96%. In addition, our system enables smart homes to detect and localize these activities at different distances up to 2.74\u00a0m, through walls, and with multiple people. We envision our system helping not only with prevention of COVID-19, but supporting contact tracing efforts by monitoring people's activities at home."

Most GC patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, for that the prognosis is dismal and metastasis is common. Although there have been increasing numbers of studies indicating that Ubenimex can suppress metastasis in GC, the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Herein, the inhibitory effect of Ubenimex on GC metastasis, in which the underlining mechanism was determined using Gene chip analysis, high content screening (HCS), transwell assays, wound healing assays and Western blot assays. The results obtained from wound healing assays and transwell assays indicated that Ubenimex, an inhibitor of CD13, suppressed the migration and invasion of MKN-28, MGC-803, BGC-823 and SGC-790 cells, by downregulating CD13 expression. In addition, the findings acquired from Gene chip analysis and HCS demonstrated that NGFI-A-binding protein 1 (NAB1) was a putative target downstream of CD13. Furthermore, the results obtained from Western blot assays showed that Ubenimex not only inhibits NAB1 expression by targeting CD13, but also inhibits GC metastasis by mitigating the activity of the MAPK signaling pathway. These findings indicated a possible mechanism via the CD13/NAB1/MAPK pathway of which activity was restrained. Ubenimex exert the inhibitory effect on GC metastasis by targeting CD13, in which NAB1 expression and the activation of MAPK signaling pathway were both suppressed. This study identified a promising target for the inhibition of GC metastasis."

        "abstract": "As an effective anticancer drug, the clinical limitation of doxorubicin (Dox) is the time- and dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) interacts with transcription factor TEA domain 1 (TEAD1) and plays an important role in cell proliferation and survival. However, the role of YAP1 in Dox-induced cardiomyopathy has not been reported. In this study, the expression of YAP1 was reduced in clinical human failing hearts with dilated cardiomyopathy and Dox-induced in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro cardiotoxic model. Ectopic expression of Yap1 significantly blocked Dox-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis in TEAD1 dependent manner. Isorhapontigenin (Isor) is a new derivative of stilbene and responsible for a wide range of biological processes. Here, we found that Isor effectively relieved Dox-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in\u00a0vitro . Administration with Isor (30\u00a0mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally, 3 weeks) significantly protected against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity in mice. Interestingly, Isor increased Dox-caused repression in YAP1 and the expression of its target genes in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro . Knockout or inhibition of Yap1 blocked the protective effects of Isor on Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. In conclusion, YAP1 may be a novel target for Dox-induced cardiotoxicity and Isor might be a new compound to fight against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity by increasing YAP1 expression. Doxorubicin (Dox) decreased the expression of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1). YAP1 alleviated Dox-induced cardiomyopathy in transcription factor TEA domain 1 (TEAD1)1-dependent manner. Isorhapontigenin effectively protected against Dox-induced cardiomyopathy and improved cardiac function by increasing the expression of YAP1. Image 1"

        "abstract": "Flowering time is a critical determinant of crop adaptation to local environments. As a result of natural and artificial selection, maize has evolved a reduced photoperiod sensitivity to adapt to regions over 90\u00b0 of latitude in the Americas. Here we show that a distant Harbinger-like transposon acts as a cis -regulatory element to repress ZmCCT9 expression to promote flowering under the long days of higher latitudes. The transposon at ZmCCT9 and another functional transposon at a second flowering-time gene, ZmCCT10 , arose sequentially following domestication and were targeted by selection as maize spread from the tropics to higher latitudes. Our results demonstrate that new functional variation created by transposon insertions helped maize to spread over a broad range of latitudes rapidly. From its tropical origin in southwestern Mexico, maize spread over a wide latitudinal cline in the Americas. This feat defies the rule that crops are inhibited from spreading easily across latitudes. How the widespread latitudinal adaptation of maize was accomplished is largely unknown. Through positional cloning and association mapping, we resolved a flowering-time quantitative trait locus to a Harbinger-like transposable element positioned 57 kb upstream of a CCT transcription factor ( ZmCCT9 ). The Harbinger-like element acts in cis to repress ZmCCT9 expression to promote flowering under long days. Knockout of ZmCCT9 by CRISPR/Cas9 causes early flowering under long days. ZmCCT9 is diurnally regulated and negatively regulates the expression of the florigen ZCN8 , thereby resulting in late flowering under long days. Population genetics analyses revealed that the Harbinger-like transposon insertion at ZmCCT9 and the CACTA-like transposon insertion at another CCT paralog, ZmCCT10 , arose sequentially following domestication and were targeted by selection for maize adaptation to higher latitudes. Our findings help explain how the dynamic maize genome with abundant transposon activity enabled maize to adapt over 90\u00b0 of latitude during the pre-Columbian era."

        "abstract": "Epiphyllous plantlets develop on leaves of Bryophyllum marnierianum when they are excised from the plant. Shortly after leaf excision, plantlet shoots develop from primordia located near the leaf margin. After the shoots have enlarged for several days, roots appear at their base. In this investigation, factors regulating plantlet root development were studied. The auxin transport inhibitor 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) abolished root formation without markedly affecting shoot growth. This suggested that auxin transport from the plantlet shoot induces root development. Excision of plantlet apical buds inhibits root development. Application of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in lanolin at the site of the apical buds restores root outgrowth. Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), a synthetic auxin, reverses TIBA inhibition of plantlet root emergence on leaf explants. Both of these observations support the hypothesis that auxin, produced by the plantlet, induces root development. Exogenous ethylene causes precocious root development several days before that of a control without hormone. Ethylene treatment cannot bypass the TIBA block of root formation. Therefore, ethylene does not act downstream of auxin in root induction. However, ethylene amplifies the effects of low concentrations of NAA, which in the absence of ethylene do not induce roots. Ag 2 S 2 O 3 , an ethylene blocker, and CoCl 2 , an ethylene synthesis inhibitor, do not abolish plantlet root development. It is therefore unlikely that ethylene is essential for root formation. Taken together, the experiments suggest that roots develop when auxin transport from the shoot reaches a certain threshold. Ethylene may augment this effect by lowering the threshold and may come into play when the parent leaf senesces."

        "abstract": "The Autism Genome Project has assembled two large datasets originally designed for linkage analysis and genome-wide association analysis, respectively: 1,069 multiplex families genotyped on the Affymetrix 10\u00a0K platform, and 1,129 autism trios genotyped on the Illumina 1\u00a0M platform. We set out to exploit this unique pair of resources by analyzing the combined data with a novel statistical method, based on the PPL statistical framework, simultaneously searching for linkage and association to loci involved in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Our analysis also allowed for potential differences in genetic architecture for ASD in the presence or absence of lower IQ, an important clinical indicator of ASD subtypes. We found strong evidence of multiple linked loci; however, association evidence implicating specific genes was low even under the linkage peaks. Distinct loci were found in the lower IQ families, and these families showed stronger and more numerous linkage peaks, while the normal IQ group yielded the strongest association evidence. It appears that presence/absence of lower IQ (LIQ) demarcates more genetically homogeneous subgroups of ASD patients, with not just different sets of loci acting in the two groups, but possibly distinct genetic architecture between them, such that the LIQ group involves more major gene effects (amenable to linkage mapping), while the normal IQ group potentially involves more common alleles with lower penetrances. The possibility of distinct genetic architecture across subtypes of ASD has implications for further research and perhaps for research approaches to other complex disorders as well."

In 2011, the Korean Association of External Quality Assessment Service (KEQAS) launched an accuracy-based Cr proficiency testing (ABCr PT) survey. We analyzed long-term data of the KEQAS ABCr PT survey collected between 2011 and 2019 to assess recent trends in Cr assays in Korea. The ABCr PT survey including three commutable fresh-frozen serum samples was performed twice a year. The target Cr concentration was assigned using isotope-dilution mass spectrometry. We analyzed data obtained from the participating laboratories, calculated the yearly bias, and evaluated bias trends for the major reagents and instruments. Outliers were excluded from all analysis. The mean percentage bias based on the total data of all participating laboratories was 10.8% in the 2011-A survey and 0.2% in 2019-B survey. Bias for the major reagents and instruments differed depending on the manufacturer. Enzymatic assays generally showed desirable bias ranging from \u20133.9% to 3.2% at all Cr concentrations and lower interlaboratory variability than non-enzymatic assays (enzymatic vs. non-enzymatic, 3.3%\u20137.2% vs. 6.3%\u20139.1%). Although the mean percentage bias of Cr assays tends to decrease over time, it is necessary to continuously strive to improve Cr assay accuracy, especially at low concentrations."

        "abstract": "Although immunotherapy works well in parts of patients with bladder cancer (BLCA), its overall response rate of anti-PD-1 inhibitors remains unsatisfactory. Besides, growing evidence shows that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) immunotherapy has demonstrated excellent efficacy in various cancers. Considering the huge heterogeneity and low overall survival rate of BLCA, it is urgent to explore the new immune checkpoints (ICs) or TILs therapy to improve the survival prognosis for BLCA patients. The public bioinformatics databases were used to explore the prognostic value of 5 potential ICs targets (TIM-3, LAG-3, OX40, 4\u20131BB and CD39). A total of 46 BLCA patients undergoing surgical treatment at our hospital from May 2020 to October 2020 were enrolled in this study. The expressions of PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3, OX40, 4\u20131BB, and CD39 in T cells of BLCA patients were explored by flow cytometry, and the correlation between different subgroups of T cells and clinicopathological parameters was analyzed. Besides, the mouse CD4+CD39+ T cells, CD4+CD39- T cells, CD8+CD39+ T cells, and CD8+CD39- T cells were sorted and co-cultured with MB49 bladder cancer cell lines in vitro to investigate the potential biomarker of tumor-reactive\u00a0TILs. Public bioinformatics databases analyses show that only the high expression of CD39 was significantly associated with advanced tumor stage ( P < 0.001) and tend to result in a worse survival rate. In our study, the elevated expression of CD39 in CD4+/CD8+ T cells were significantly associated with the pathological T stage (pT <2, P = 0.041) and papillary tumor ( P = 0.038). Moreover, the CD8+CD39+ T cells showed a stronger tumor-killing effect and produced a higher level of IFN-\u03b3 than other T cell populations. CD39 may be a potential prognostic marker in BLCA, and CD8+CD39+ T cells may be selected as tumor-reactive and killing T cells for TILs therapy."

While the diagnostics for gastrointestinal bacterial and parasitic pathogens and their etiological role in disease are well established, little is known about the epidemiology, prevalence and role of viral agents in diarrheal illness among monkeys.  Methods We collected fecal specimens from monkeys with diarrhea that were housed in two primate colonies, the Institute of Laboratory Animal Sciences, Beijing, China and the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Georgia, USA. We screened these fecal specimens for rotaviruses and enteric adenoviruses 40/41 by using commercial EIA kits (Rotaclone and Adenoclone), enteroviruses by RT\u2010PCR and Southern blot hybridization, and picobirnaviruses by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Some of the specimens were examined by EM for coronaviruses and noroviruses.  Results Of the 92 specimens from China, we found 63 (68%) positive for viruses, including enteroviruses (52%), enteric adenoviruses (21%), rotaviruses (20%), and picobirnaviruses (2%). Coronaviruses were detected in some specimens. Mixed infection of two or more viral agents was seen in 23 (25%) specimens. In the US collection, we detected enteroviruses and enteric adenoviruses in 76% (45/59) and 14% (7/50) of the specimens, respectively. Electron microscopy showed norovirus\u2010like particles in some specimens from both colonies.  Conclusions Our findings indicate endemic infections with enteric viruses in monkeys of both colonies. The availability of new simian rotaviruses, enteric adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and coronaviruses and the discovery of noroviruses and picobirnaviruses may allow us to develop better diagnostics for these agents and determine which of these agents are clearly associated with gastroenteritis in monkeys."

Seroconversion was defined as a > 4-fold increase in antibody titers to pandemic (H1N1) 2009, determined by using hemagglutination inhibition. Men were more likely than women to seroconvert (mean adjusted hazards ratio [HR] 2.23, mean 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26\u20133.93); Malays were more likely than Chinese to seroconvert (HR 2.67, 95% CI 1.04\u20136.91).

Although Westernization may contribute to the weight gain in populations of Oceanian, Non-European, Non-Asian ancestry (ONENA), little is known about the sociodemographic and lifestyle factors associated with overweight in the Melanesian and Polynesian adolescents of New Caledonia. In this cross-sectional study, a pluri-ethnic sample of New Caledonian adolescents (N\u00a0=\u00a0954; age M\u00a0=\u00a013.2 years) completed a survey to estimate sleep duration, screen time, and dietary pattern using a food frequency questionnaire. Demographic data (gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status: SES, area of residence) were collected, and anthropometric measures were used to compute weight status. We found a higher risk for being overweight in Melanesian (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.67) and Polynesian (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.40) adolescents compared with European adolescents, even after controlling for age, SES, area of residence, dietary pattern, sleep duration and screen time. We also found that low SES (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.43) and sleep duration (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.65 per hour) were independently associated with overweight status in the European but not in ONENA adolescents. In this study, the main contribution to being overweight was ethnic background, i.e. being Melanesian or Polynesian. The hypothesis of a genetic influence thus seems attractive and merits further analyses. This project was funded by the University of New Caledonia and the Fondation Nestl\u00e9 France."

Cadmium stress (50\u00a0\u03bcM) caused significant changes in the growth and physio-biochemical attributes studied. AMF mitigated the deleterious impact of Cd on the parameters studied. Cadmium stress increased malonaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide production but AMF reduced these parameters by mitigating oxidative stress. The activity of antioxidant enzymes enhanced under Cd treatment and AMF inoculation further enhanced their activity, thus strengthening the plant\u2019s defense system. Proline and phenol content increased in Cd-treated as well as AMF-inoculated plants providing efficient protection against Cd stress. Cadmium treatment resulted in great alterations in the main lipid classes leading to a marked change in their composition. Cadmium stress caused a significant reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acids resulting in enhanced membrane leakage. The present study supports the use of AMF as a biological means to ameliorate Cd stress-induced changes in tomato."

These children are now reaching into adolescence and sexually active. This qualitative, explorative study examines the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) needs and concerns of adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) in India. We used qualitative research design to collect the data. Twenty participants were recruited from two nongovernmental organizations which provide shelter care, education, and emotional and social support to HIV/AIDS orphan children located in Bengaluru District of Karnataka State using purposive sampling. In-depth interview guide was prepared and used to elicit the adolescents' concerns, knowledge, and perspective related to sexuality, marriage, child bearing, and barriers in availing SRH services in the context of HIV. Totally, four themes were emerged from that qualitative data based on thematic analysis, which are as follows: \u201cPerceived challenges in relation to romantic relationship;\u201d \u201cConfusion regarding whether to marry person with HIV positive or HIV negative;\u201d \u201cAspiration to have children,\u201d and \u201cPerspective of ALHIV in relation to SRH needs and concerns.\u201d The findings of the research brought out the need for policies and guidelines specifically targeting the SRH needs and concerns of ALHIV."

        "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) has dramatic mid- and long-term consequences at the physiological and behavioral levels, but the mechanisms involved are still unclear. Our laboratory has developed a rat model of post-MI syndrome that displays impaired cardiac functions, neuronal loss in the limbic system, cognitive deficits and behavioral signs of depression. At the neuronal level, caspase-3 activation mediates post-MI apoptosis in different limbic regions, such as the amygdala \u2013 peaking at 3 days post-MI. Cognitive and behavioral impairments appear 2-3 weeks post-MI and these correlate statistically with measures of caspase-3 activity. The protocol described here is used to induce MI, collect amygdala tissue and measure caspase-3 activity using spectrofluorometry. To induce MI, the descending coronary artery is occluded for 40 min. The protocol for evaluation of caspase-3 activation starts 3 days after MI: the rats are sacrificed and the amygdala isolated rapidly from the brain. Samples are quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80 \u00b0C until actual analysis. The technique performed to assess caspase-3 activation is based on cleavage of a substrate (DEVD-AMC) by caspase-3, which releases a fluorogenic compound that can be measured by spectrofluorometry. The methodology is quantitative and reproducible but the equipment required is expensive and the procedure for quantifying the samples is time-consuming. This technique can be applied to other tissues, such as the heart and kidneys. DEVD-AMC can be replaced by other substrates to measure the activity of other caspases."

        "abstract": "Cellular, animal, and human epidemiological studies suggested that benzodiazepines increase the risk of cancer and cancer mortality. Obesity is also clearly linked to carcinogenesis. However, no human studies have examined benzodiazepine-associated carcinogenesis as assessed by changes in cancer biomarkers. A total of 19 patients were recruited, and received a 6-week treatment of 0.5 mg lorazepam. The measured cancer biomarkers were angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2), soluble CD40 ligand, epidermal growth factor, endoglin, soluble Fas ligand (sFASL), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), insulin-like growth factor binding protein, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-18, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PLGF), placental growth factor, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, urokinase-type plasminogen (uPA), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D. Six cancer biomarkers were significantly increased in all patients as a whole. The subgroup analysis revealed a distinct pattern of change. Overweight patients showed a significant increase in 11 cancer biomarkers, including ANG-2, sFASL, HB-EGF, IL-8, PLGF, TGF-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, uPA, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D. However, normal-weight patients did not show any changes in cancer biomarkers. Adiposity may have primed the carcinogenic potential, leading to lorazepam-associated carcinogenesis in overweight patients. Epidemiological studies addressing this issue should consider the potential modulator contributing to benzodiazepine-associated carcinogenesis."

In the present study, the functional mechanisms of microRNA-141 (miR-141) were assessed, and the potential role of miR-141 as a prognostic biomarker in glioblastoma was examined. The gene expression of miR-141 in glioblastoma cell lines and glioblastoma tumors was assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Glioblastoma LN229 and U89 cell lines were transfected with synthetic miR-141 mimics to upregulate endogenous miR-141. The subsequent effect on glioblastoma proliferation was assessed by MTT assay. In human glioblastoma, miR-141 expression was compared between patients with tumors of different pathological grades. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the correlation between miR-141 and the clinicopathological properties and overall survival rates (OS) of the patients. In addition, a Cox regression model was used to examine whether miR-141 was a potential biomarker of glioblastoma. miR-141 was aberrantly downregulated in glioblastoma cell lines and human glioblastoma tumors. Forced miR-141 upregulation in glioblastoma LN229 and U89 cell lines suppressed cancer proliferation. In patients with glioblastoma, miR-141 downregulation was closely associated with an advanced disease stage, poor clinicopathological properties and a shorter OS time. The multivariate Cox regression model demonstrated that low miR-141 expression was an effective prognostic biomarker for patients with glioblastoma. Overall, the present study showed that miR-141 may be a functional cancer regulator and a prognostic biomarker for glioblastoma."

Sleep hygiene education and relaxation techniques are recommended to improve sleep in healthy children and adult cancer survivors. No studies have tested these interventions to improve sleep and fatigue for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the home setting. The aim of this study is to establish the feasibility and acceptability of a sleep hygiene and relaxation intervention to improve sleep and fatigue for children receiving maintenance chemotherapy for ALL. The child's fatigue and sleep data were collected to inform sample size calculations for a future trial. In this pilot randomized controlled trial, 20 children were allocated randomly to the sleep intervention or control group. The sleep intervention group received a 60-minute educational session to discuss sleep and fatigue in children with cancer and strategies to improve sleep, including use of 2 storybooks to teach deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation. Objective sleep data were collected using actigraphy and fatigue was measured using the Childhood Cancer Fatigue Scale. The intervention was acceptable to families, and feasibility of the intervention and data collection was clearly established. Although not statistically significant, increases in mean nighttime sleep and decreases in mean wake time after sleep onset in the sleep intervention group represented clinically important improvements. This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of a sleep hygiene and relaxation intervention for children undergoing maintenance chemotherapy for ALL. Given the clinically important improvements in sleep observed, replication in a larger, adequately powered randomized controlled trial is merited."

The result will help assess the relevance of VA gain comparisons across trials. A correlation analysis was performed between mean baseline VA and VA gain at month 12 for 1,616 diabetic macular edema patients across nine randomized clinical trials (RESOLVE, RISE, RIDE, RESTORE, RETAIN, DRCR.net Protocol I, DA VINCI, VIVID, VISTA) with anti-VEGF treatment regimens ranibizumab 0.5 mg and aflibercept 2 mg. The mean baseline VA ranged from 56.9 to 64.8 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters. The mean VA gain at month 12 ranged from 6.8 to 13.1 ETDRS letters across trials. There was a strong inverse correlation between mean baseline VA and VA gain at month 12 ( r =\u22120.85). The mean VA at 12 months plateaued at ~70 (68.5\u201373.0) ETDRS letters (20/40 Snellen VA equivalent) for the anti-VEGF treatment groups from all trials, regardless of dosing regimens and agents. Cross-trial comparisons based on changes in best-corrected visual acuity should be done cautiously and only after adjusting for best-corrected visual acuity at baseline. Furthermore, the total VA afforded by treatment appears to be subject to a plateau effect, which warrants further exploration."

To determine the rate of LN metastases and its impact in survival in patients with GNEN1 in relation to certain clinico-pathological parameters. The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Scopus databases were searched through January 2019. The quality of the included studies and risk of bias were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) in accordance with the Cochrane guidelines. A random effects model and pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95%CI were applied for the quantitative meta-analysis. We screened 2933 articles. Thirteen studies with 769 unique patients with GNEN1 were included. Overall, the rate of metastasis to locoregional LNs was 3.3% (25/769). The rate of LN metastases with a cut-off size of 10 mm was 15.3% for lesions > 10 mm ( vs 0.8% for lesions < 10 mm) with a random-effects OR of 10.5 (95%CI: 1.4 -80.8; heterogeneity: P = 0.126; I 2 = 47.5%). Invasion of the muscularis propria was identified as a predictor for LN metastases (OR: 17.2; 95%CI: 1.8-161.1; heterogeneity: P = 0.165; I 2 = 44.5%), whereas grade was not clearly associated with LN metastases (OR: 2; 95%CI: 0.3-11.6; heterogeneity: P = 0.304; I 2 = 17.4%). With regard to GNEN1 local recurrence, scarce data were available. The 5-year disease-specific survival for patients with and without LN metastases was 100% in most available studies irrespective of the type of intervention. Surgical resection was linked to a lower risk of recurrence (OR: 0.3; 95%CI: 0.1-1.1; heterogeneity: P = 0.173; I 2 = 31.9%). The reported complication rates of endoscopic and surgical intervention were 0.6 and 3.8%, respectively. This meta-analysis confirms that tumor size \u2265 10 mm and invasion of the muscularis propria are linked to a higher risk of LN metastases in patients with GNEN1. Overall, the metastatic propensity of GNEN1 is low with favorable 5-year disease-specific survival rates reported; hence, no clear evidence of the prognostic value of LN positivity is available. Additionally, there is a lack of evidence supporting the prediction of local recurrence in GNEN1, even if surgery was more often a definitive treatment."

These tonic currents can be enhanced by low-dose isoflurane, which is associated with learning and memory impairment. Inverse agonists of \u03b15 GABAARs, such as L-655,708, are able to reverse the short-term memory deficit caused by low-dose isoflurane in young animals. However, whether these negative allosteric modulators have the same effects on aged rats remains unclear. In the present study, we mainly investigated the effects of L-655,708 on low-dose (1.3%) isoflurane-induced learning and memory impairment in elderly rats. Young (3-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) Wistar rats were randomly assigned to receive L-655,708 0.5 hour before or 23.5 hours after 1.3% isoflurane anesthesia. The Morris Water Maze tests demonstrated that L-655,708 injected before or after anesthesia could reverse the memory deficit in young rats. But in aged rats, application of L-655,708 only before anesthesia showed similar effects. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that low-dose isoflurane decreased the mRNA expression of \u03b15 GABAARs in aging hippocampal neurons but increased that in young animals. These findings indicate that L-655,708 prevented but could not reverse 1.3% isoflurane-induced spatial learning and memory impairment in aged Wistar rats. All experimental procedures and protocols were approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of Academy of Military Medical Science of China (approval No. NBCDSER-IACUC-2015128) in December 2015."

DA was structured in two main steps; 1) Baseline analysis (Assessing the probabilities of outcomes, Assessing the values of preference -utilities-, Combining information on probability and utility and assigning the quality adjusted life expectancy (QALE) for each treatment) and 2) Sensitivity analysis. Complications were analyzed as life threatening (LT) and nonlife threatening (NLT) and their probabilities were calculated from the database as well as a thorough literature review. Outcomes were analyzed as improvement, no change and deterioration. Death/complete paralysis was considered as a separate category. All 535 patients were analyzed in regard to complications. Overall, there were 78 NLT and 12 LT complications and 3 death/paralysis. Surgical treatment offered significantly higher chances of clinical improvement but also was significantly more prone to complications (31.7% vs. 11.1%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Surgical treatment of ASD is more likely to cause complications compared to NS treatment. On the other hand, surgery has been shown to provide a higher likelihood of improvement in HRQoL scores. So, the decision on the type of treatment in ASD needs to take both chances of improvement and burden associated with S or NS treatments and better be arrived by the active participation of patients and physicians equipped with the present information.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate associations between clinical laboratory parameters with genetic polymorphisms that influence the risk of IS in a Chinese Han population. Clinical laboratory parameters were measured by an automatic biochemical analyzer. Genotype and allele frequencies of the polymorphisms angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) D/I, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and \u03b2-fibrinogen (\u03b2-Fg) A/G, 455/148T/C were characterized by restriction fragment length polymorphism-PCR. Furthermore, the gene polymorphisms plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1-4G/5G and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) \u03b52,3,4 were characterized by allele-specific PCR. The associations of genotype and allele frequencies of the six risk genes in different groups with clinical laboratory parameters were analyzed by chi-square tests. The distribution maps of the polymorphisms of the six genes and clinical laboratory parameters were compared between a control group of 336 healthy individuals and 762 patients with IS. Certain laboratory parameters were associated with ACE I/D, \u03b2-Fg-455 A/G and PAI-1 4G/5G. The D allele of ACE I/D was associated with high levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Furthermore, high levels of fasting blood glucose, triglyceride and LDL-C were risk factors for IS. There were significant differences in the genotype frequencies of ACE I/D, \u03b2-Fg-455 A/G and \u03b2-Fg-148 T/C between the IS and the control group. In conclusion, clinical laboratory parameters were associated with the risk of polymorphisms of IS-related genes. The present results support the determination of a range of control values of clinical laboratory parameters for common genotypes in patients with diabetes and hyperlipidemia as a strategy for the early prevention of IS."

This is a review study by searching of the most important clinical and pharmaceutical TPM textbooks such as The Canon of Medicine by Avicenna and scientific data banks using keywords such as \u201cHozal-e-Kolye\u201d, renal atrophy, tubular atrophy, kidney, chronic kidney disease, and end stage renal disease. This paper found that \u201cHozal-e-Kolye\u201d in TPM texts is the same tubular atrophy in conventional medicine due to some similar symptoms between them. Lifestyle modification and use of proposed foodstuffs can be considered as a complementary medicine in addition to conventional treatments to manage these patients. TPM scholars prescribed some foodstuffs such as camel milk, sheep's milk and Ficus carica for this disease as a complementary management. This study aimed to explain HK (the same tubular atrophy considering their similar symptoms) and introduce some foodstuffs. It seems using of foodstuffs affecting tubular atrophy based on TPM literatures can has a role as a supplemental method in company with conventional medicine management."

It was shown to induce apoptosis via a direct effect on mitochondria. This is largely independent of proapoptotic BAK and BAX, but can be inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of the permeability transition (PT) pore. Here we show that blocking apoptosis with general caspase inhibitors did not prevent cell death, indicating that alternative, caspase-independent cell death pathways were activated. BetA did not induce necroptosis, but we observed a strong induction of autophagy in several cancer cell lines. Autophagy was functional as shown by enhanced flux and degradation of long-lived proteins. BetA-induced autophagy could be blocked, just like apoptosis, with CsA, suggesting that autophagy is activated as a response to the mitochondrial damage inflicted by BetA. As both a survival and cell death role have been attributed to autophagy, autophagy-deficient tumor cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts were analyzed to determine the role of autophagy in BetA-induced cell death. This clearly established BetA-induced autophagy as a survival mechanism and indicates that BetA utilizes an as yet-undefined mechanism to kill cancer cells."

        "abstract": "Among tuberculosis (TB) patients, acquired resistance to anti-TB drugs represents a failure in the treatment pathway. To improve diagnosis and care for patients with drug-resistant TB, we examined the epidemiology and risk factors associated with acquired drug resistance during 2000\u20132015 among TB patients in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. We found acquired resistance in 0.2% (158/67,710) of patients with culture-confirmed TB. Using multivariate logistic regression, we identified the following factors associated with acquired drug resistance: having pulmonary disease; initial resistance to isoniazid, rifampin, or both; a previous TB episode; and being born in China or South Africa. Treatment outcomes were worse for patients with than without acquired resistance. Although acquired resistance is rare in the study area, certain patient groups are at higher risk. Identifying these patients and ensuring that adequate resources are available for treatment may prevent acquisition of resistance, thereby limiting transmission of drug-resistant strains of mycobacteria."

A cross-sectional study involved 250 patients with hypertension (\u2265140/90\u2264179/109 mmHg) selected from government hospitals in Osun State, Nigeria. Purposive sampling technique was used to select participants. Socio-demographic characteristics and cardiovascular parameters were recorded. PA and HRQoL were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and Short Form health survey questionnaire respectively. Sufficient PA equals \u2265150 min/wk while BWS was defined using body mass index classification. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Alpha level was set at P <0.05. Of all participants, 63.6% reported sufficient PA and 78.4% was either overweight or obese. The HRQoL of participants become poorer in all domains with higher body weight. The HRQoL including role limitation due to physical health (RLdPhp) and emotional problems (RLdEmp) had worst scores. Participants in the categories of normal and overweight/obese with sufficient PA demonstrated higher (better) HRQoL in all domains than those with insufficient PA ( P <0.05). When adjusted for body weight, significant differences were found in all domains of HRQoL except in RLdPhp, RldEmp, and bodily pain ( P >0.05). There were significant correlations between PA and all domains of HRQoL except in RldEmp, emotional well-being and bodily pain ( P >0.05). Regression models established PA as a significant predictor of HRQoL. Sufficient PA is a better predictor of HRQoL among patients with hypertension irrespective of BWS. Regular PA is recommended for improving HRQoL among patients with hypertension."

However, the association between miR-16-2-3p and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDPK1) in nonsyndromic cleft lip (NSCL) remains unclear. In the present study, a luciferase activity assay indicated that miR-16-2-3p negatively regulated PDPK1 in maxillary primordium mesenchymal cells (MPMCs). In addition, it was confirmed that the expression levels of miR-16-2-3p was markedly increased in cleft lip tissues compared with those in adjacent normal lip tissues. A negative correlation between miR-16-2-3p and PDPK1 in cleft lip tissues was observed. Furthermore, miR-16-2-3p inhibited cell proliferation and migration, and induced apoptosis of MPMCs via repressing PDPK1. Finally, miR-16-2-3p exerted its suppressive role in MPMCs by inhibiting the PDPK1/protein kinase B signaling pathway. These results indicate that miR-16-2-3p may inhibit cell proliferation and migration, and promote apoptosis in MPMCs through repression of PDPK1 and may be a potential target for future clinical prevention and treatment of NSCL."

The present study aimed to investigate the association between ADSCs and liver cancer cells, and to determine whether culture methods could influence the effects of ADSCs on liver cancer cell growth in vitro . Liver cancer cells were treated with ADSCs-conditioned medium (CM) that was collected using the two-dimensional (2D) culture method, sphere culture method, or three-dimensional (3D) culture method. After that, cell viability and apoptosis were measured using CCK-8 and Annexin V-FITC assay, respectively; the cell motility and adhesive capacity were analyzed by scratch wound healing and cell adhesion assay, respectively; the cell migration and invasion were examined by Transwell units; and the molecular mechanisms of ADSCs on effecting epithelial mesenchymal transition signaling pathway were further analyzed. The results demonstrated that ADSCs-CM was able to inhibit the growth of liver cancer cells by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting cell apoptosis, as well as by suppressing cell motility, adhesive capacity, migration and invasion. In addition, ADSCs-CM was able to suppress cell growth via the downregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition signaling. Notably, the enhanced inhibitory effects of ADSCs on liver cancer cell growth could be achieved after cultu ring using a 3D approach. These findings suggested that ADSCs may provide a novel promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients with liver cancer, and the 3D culture method may provide a novel approach to explore the association between ADSCs and cancer."

        "abstract": " In vitro transcriptional signatures that predict toxicities can facilitate chemical screening. We previously developed a transcriptomic biomarker (known as TGx\u201028.65) for classifying agents as genotoxic (DNA damaging) and non\u2010genotoxic in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells. Because TK6 cells do not express cytochrome P450s, we confirmed accurate classification by the biomarker in cells co\u2010exposed to 1% 5,6 benzoflavone/phenobarbital\u2010induced rat liver S9 for metabolic activation. However, chemicals may require different types of S9 for activation. Here we investigated the response of TK6 cells to higher percentages of Aroclor\u2010, benzoflavone/phenobarbital\u2010, or ethanol\u2010induced rat liver S9 to expand TGx\u201028.65 biomarker applicability. Transcriptional profiles were derived 3 to 4 hr following a 4 hr co\u2010exposure of TK6 cells to test chemicals and S9. Preliminary studies established that 10% Aroclor\u2010 and 5% ethanol\u2010induced S9 alone did not induce the TGx\u201028.65 biomarker genes. Seven genotoxic and two non\u2010genotoxic chemicals (and concurrent solvent and positive controls) were then tested with one of the S9s (selected based on cell survival and micronucleus induction). Relative survival and micronucleus frequency was assessed by flow cytometry in cells 20 hr post\u2010exposure. Genotoxic/non\u2010genotoxic chemicals were accurately classified using the different S9s. One technical replicate of cells co\u2010treated with dexamethasone and 10% Aroclor\u2010induced S9 was falsely classified as genotoxic, suggesting caution in using high S9 concentrations. Even low concentrations of genotoxic chemicals (those not causing cytotoxicity) were correctly classified, demonstrating that TGx\u201028.65 is a sensitive biomarker of genotoxicity. A meta\u2010analysis of datasets from 13 chemicals supports that different S9s can be used in TK6 cells, without impairing classification using the TGx\u201028.65 biomarker. Environ. Mol.

To examine associations between these periods of quarantine and mental health, including suicidal ideation and deliberate self-harm, we examined data from a national survey of 3000 Canadian adults distributed between May 14-29, 2020. Notably, participants provided the reason(s) for quarantine. When pooling all reasons for quarantine together, this experience was associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation and deliberate self-harm in the two weeks preceding the survey. These associations remained even after controlling for age, household income, having a pre-existing mental health condition, being unemployed due to the pandemic, and living alone. However, the associations with mental health differed across reasons for quarantine; those who were self-isolating specifically due to recent travel were not found to have higher odds of suicidal ideation or deliberate self-harm. Our research suggests the importance of accounting for the reason(s) for quarantine in the implementation of this critical public health measure to reduce the mental health impacts of this experience."

        "abstract": "Naturally occurring paramagnetic species (PS), such as free radicals and paramagnetic metalloproteins, play an essential role in a multitude of critical physiological processes including metabolism, cell signaling, and immune response. These highly dynamic species can also act as intrinsic biomarkers for a variety of disease states, while synthetic paramagnetic probes targeted to specific sites on biomolecules enable the study of functional information such as tissue oxygenation and redox status in living systems. The work presented herein describes a new sensing method that exploits the spin-dependent emission of photoluminescence (PL) from an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond for rapid, nondestructive detection of PS in living systems. Uniquely this approach involves simple measurement protocols that assess PL contrast with and without the application of microwaves. The method is demonstrated to detect concentrations of paramagnetic salts in solution and the widely used magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent gadobutrol with a limit of detection of less than 10 attomol over a 100 \u03bcm \u00d7 100 \u03bcm field of view. Real-time monitoring of changes in the concentration of paramagnetic salts is demonstrated with image exposure times of 20 ms. Further, dynamic tracking of chemical reactions is demonstrated via the conversion of low-spin cyanide-coordinated Fe 3+ to hexaaqua Fe 3+ under acidic conditions. Finally, the capability to map paramagnetic species in model cells with subcellular resolution is demonstrated using lipid membranes containing gadolinium-labeled phospholipids under ambient conditions in the order of minutes. Overall, this work introduces a new sensing approach for the realization of fast, sensitive imaging of PS in a widefield format that is readily deployable in biomedical settings. Ultimately, this new approach to nitrogen vacancy-based quantum sensing paves the way toward minimally invasive real-time mapping and observation of free radicals in in vitro cellular environments."

Research that incorporates granular assessments of housing status and primary care visit adherence to understand patterns of acute care utilization can help pinpoint areas for intervention. We collected self-reported living situation, categorized as stable (rent/own, hotel/single room occupancy), unstable (treatment/transitional program, staying with friends), or homeless (homeless shelter, outdoors/in vehicle) at an urban safety-net HIV clinic between February and August 2017 and abstracted demographic and clinical information from the medical record. Regression models evaluated the association of housing status on the frequency of acute care visits\u2014urgent care (UC) visits, emergency department (ED) visits, and hospitalizations\u2014and whether suboptimal primary care visit adherence (<75%) interacted with housing status on acute care visits. Among 1198 patients, 25% experienced HUH. In adjusted models, unstable housing resulted in a statistically significant increase in the incidence rate ratio for UC visits (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10 to 1.66; P < .001), ED visits (IRR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.44 to 3.13; P < .001), and hospitalizations (IRR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.77; P = 0.018). Homelessness led to even greater increases in UC visits (IRR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.39; P < .001), ED visits (IRR, 4.18; 95% CI, 2.77 to 6.30; P < .001), and hospitalizations (IRR, 3.18; 95% CI, 2.03 to 4.97; P < .001). Suboptimal visit adherence differentially impacted UC and ED visits by housing status, suggesting interaction. Increased acute care visit frequency among HUH-PLWH suggests that interventions at these visits may create opportunities to improve care."

Vitreous incarceration was detected in 91.3% (43.5% G1, 47.8% G2) of the sclerotomies used by the vitreous cutter probe, 95.7% (45.7% G1, 50% G2) of the illumination-pipe entrances, and 93.5% (45.7% G1, 47.8% G2) of the infusion-line incisions. No statistical differences were found when comparing incisional vitreous incarceration after vitrectomy according to sclerotomy use. Different manipulation of the sclerotomies, depending on their use, does not seem to influence postvitrectomy vitreous entrapment in our experimental model."

This study proposes, for the first time, a method for assaying TTN in separated porcine skin layers ( stratum corneum , viable epidermis, and dermis). The skin studies were carried out using tape stripping and cutaneous retention techniques. The procedures for the extraction of TTN from dermatological formulations (creams and gels) and biological and non-biological matrices used with the tape stripping and retention techniques were also evaluated. The LC method consisted of a mobile phase composed of a mixture of methanol, water, and glacial acetic acid (85:15:1, v/v); a C18 column used as the stationary phase; a flow rate of 1.0 mL min \u22121 ; an injection volume of 100 \u03bcL; and TTN detection at 342 nm. The method was linear in the range of 0.05\u201315.00 \u03bcg mL \u22121 (r = 0.9999), and it was precise and accurate. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.0165 \u03bcg mL \u22121 and 0.0495 \u03bcg mL \u22121 , respectively. TTN was extracted from different matrices, showing good precision [relative standard deviation (RSD) of <5%] and accuracy (89.4\u2013113.9%). This method was successfully applied in the evaluation of TTN skin retention/permeation from dermatological formulations (cream and gel). A higher penetration of TTN through the skin was achieved with the gel rather than the cream, showing the influence of the dosage form. Therefore, the developed method can easily be applied in porcine skin penetration/retention studies of dermatological formulations containing TTN, and it is able to discriminate the behaviours of the different formulations.

The study is being performed in 15 countries in three continents.

All mothers recruited were encouraged to breastfeed. The intervention lasted for 6 to 8\u00a0months, and weaning formulas based on hydrolysed casein and standard cow\u2019s milk were compared. TRIGR recruited 5,606 infants, of whom 2,160 were enrolled as eligible participants, 6% more than the target of 2,032. Of those enrolled, 80% were exposed to the study formula. The overall retention rate over the first 5\u00a0years is 87%, with protocol compliance at 94%.

There are numerous clinical symptoms associated with DGP, as well as high treatment costs and markedly reduced patient quality of life. However, the pathogenesis of DGP is not clear, thus effective treatment methods are yet to be established. In the present study, a DGP rat model was established in Sprague-Dawley rats by the intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ). DGP model rats were treated with different doses of atractylenolide-1 to detect alterations in gastrointestinal function, including gastroparesis, gastric emptying, gastric motility, gastric peristalsis and gastric blood flow. Compared with the DGP group, atractylenolide-1 treatment significantly reduced glycaemia and the level of glycated hemoglobin, as well as restoring gastrointestinal function. Gastroparesis, gastric emptying, gastric motility, gastric peristalsis and gastric blood flow were significantly impaired in the STZ-induced group compared with the vehicle control group. Moreover, the STZ-induced group displayed downregulated expression levels of the DGP indicator KIT proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase (c-kit), as investigated by immunohistochemistry, and stem cell factor (SCF) protein, as assessed using ELISA, significantly enhanced rat interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) apoptosis, and significantly altered levels of oxidative stress-related markers (malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase) in the serum and gastric tissues compared with the vehicle control group. By contrast, treatment with atractylenolide-1 significantly counteracted the effects of DGP on peristalsis, inhibited apoptosis and suppressed oxidative stress by regulating the expression of heme oxygenase 1 in STZ-induced DGP model rats. Further research indicated that atractylenolide-1 regulated oxidative stress reactions and improved gastric function by activating the SCF/c-kit signaling pathway. Collectively, the results of the present study suggested that atractylenolide-1 promoted ICC survival and preserved the structure of the gastric tissue network in a DGP rat model via the SCF/c-kit signaling pathway, providing novel insights for the treatment of DGP."

        "abstract": "Longitudinal studies drawn from high-income countries demonstrate long-term associations of early childhood socioeconomic deprivation with increased adiposity in adulthood. However, there are very few data from resource-poor countries where there are reasons to anticipate different gradients. Accordingly, we sought to characterise the nature of the socioeconomic status (SES)-adiposity association in Brazil. We use data from the Ribeirao Preto Cohort Study in Brazil in which 9067 newborns were recruited via their mothers in 1978/79 and one-in-three followed up in 2002/04 (23\u201325years). SES, based on family income (salaries, interest on savings, pensions and so on), was assessed at birth and early adulthood, and three different adiposity measures (body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)) ascertained at follow-up. The association between childhood SES, adult SES and social mobility (defined as four permutations of SES in childhood and adulthood: low\u2013low, low\u2013high, high\u2013low, high\u2013high), and the adiposity measures was examined using linear regression. There was evidence that the association between SES and the three markers of adiposity was modified by gender in both adulthood ( P <0.02 for all outcomes) and childhood SES ( P <0.02 for WC and WHR). Thus, in an unadjusted model, linear regression analyses showed that higher childhood SES was associated with lower adiposity in women (coefficient (95% confidence intervals) BMI: \u22121.49 (\u22122.29,\u22120.69); WC: \u22123.85 (\u22125.73,\u22121.97); WHR: \u22120.03 (\u22120.04,\u22120.02)). However, in men, higher childhood SES was related to higher adiposity (BMI: 1.03 (0.28,\u22121.78); WC: 3.15 (1.20, 5.09); WHR: 0.009 (\u22120.001, 0.019)) although statistical significance was not seen in all analyses. There was a suggestion that adult SES (but not adult health behaviours or birthweight) accounted for these relationships in women only. Upward mobility was associated with protection against greater adiposity in women but not men. In the present study, in men there was some evidence that both higher childhood and adulthood SES was related to a higher adiposity risk, while the reverse gradient was apparent in women."

The review was designed to evaluate the frequency of ADRs, both resulting in hospital admission and occurring during the hospital stay of older patients, while identifying the types of reactions and the associated drugs. Age, sex, date, and diagnosis of admission of all patients aged 65 and over admitted in three geriatric wards of University Hospital of Verona, Italy, from February to July 2009 were registered by nurses on a special form. In the specific cases of admissions caused by an ADR as well as in the cases of an ADR occurring during the hospital stay, the type of reactions and the suspected drugs were also registered by nurses and physicians involved in the study. During the six months of the study, 1023 patients matched the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. One hundred fourteen hospital admissions (11.1%) were caused by ADRs, while 256 patients (25.0%) had an ADR during their hospital stay. The duration of hospital stay was significantly longer in patients who developed an ADR during their time in hospital, 18.7 (95% CI: 17.2\u201320.1) days versus 12.6 (95% CI: 11.9\u201313.3) days. Electrolyte disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, anemia, and International Normalized Ratio increase were the more frequent observed ADRs, with diuretics, antithrombotic agents, and antibacterials as the main involved drugs. Our study confirms that ADRs are an important cause of hospitalization in older patients. In addition, the frequency of ADRs occurring during hospital stay is high and causes prolonged hospitalization."

        "abstract": "Dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis causes human diseases, such as Diamond-Blackfan anemia, del (5q-) syndrome and bone marrow failure. However, the mechanisms of blood disorders in these diseases remain elusive. Through genetic mapping, molecular cloning and mechanism characterization of the zebrafish mutant cas002 , we reveal a novel connection between ribosomal dysfunction and excessive autophagy in the regulation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). cas002 carries a recessive lethal mutation in kri1l gene that encodes an essential component of rRNA small subunit processome. We show that Kri1l is required for normal ribosome biogenesis, expansion of definitive HSPCs and subsequent lineage differentiation. Through live imaging and biochemical studies, we find that loss of Kri1l causes the accumulation of misfolded proteins and excessive PERK activation-dependent autophagy in HSPCs. Blocking autophagy but not inhibiting apoptosis by Bcl2 overexpression can fully rescue hematopoietic defects, but not the lethality of kri1l cas002 embryos. Treatment with autophagy inhibitors (3-MA and Baf A1) or PERK inhibitor (GSK2656157), or knockdown of beclin1 or perk can markedly restore HSPC proliferation and definitive hematopoietic cell differentiation. These results may provide leads for effective therapeutics that benefit patients with anemia or bone marrow failure caused by ribosome disorders."

The BRB is thought to be part of the specialised ocular microenvironment that confers protection or \u201cimmune privilege\u201d by deviating or suppressing destructive inflammation. The barrier between the blood circulation and the retina is maintained at two separate anatomical sites. These are the endothelial cells of the inner retinal vasculature and the retinal pigment epithelial cells on Bruch\u2019s membrane between the fenestrated choroidal vessels and the outer retina. The structure and regulation of the tight junctions forming the physical barrier are described. For leukocyte migration across the BRB to occur, changes are needed in both the leukocytes themselves and the cells forming the barrier. We review how the blood\u2013retina barrier is compromised in various inflammatory diseases and discuss the mechanisms controlling leukocyte subset migration into the retina in uveoretinitis in more detail. In particular, we examine the relative roles of selectins and integrins in leukocyte interactions with the vascular endothelium and the pivotal role of chemokines in selective recruitment of leukocyte subsets, triggering adhesion, diapedesis and migration of inflammatory cells into the retinal tissue."

In the present study, we investigated the underlying mechanisms and suggest that costunolide induces apoptosis in human promonocytic leukemia U937 cells by depleting the intracellular thiols. Costunolide treatment rapidly depleted the intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) and protein thiols, and this preceded the occurrence of apoptosis. Pretreatment with sulfhydryl compounds such as GSH, N\u2010acetyl\u2010L\u2010cysteine, dithiothreitol and 2\u2010mercaptoethanol almost completely blocked the costunolide\u2010induced apoptosis, highlighting the significance of the intracellular thiol level in the process. Furthermore, overexpression of Bcl\u20102 also significantly attenuated the effects of costunolide. The apoptosis\u2010inducing activity of costunolide is likely to depend on the exomethylene moiety because derivatives in which this group was reduced, such as dihydrocostunolide and saussurea lactone, did not deplete the cellular thiols and showed no apoptotic activity. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that the costunolide\u2010induced apoptosis depends on intracellular thiols contents, which are modulated by Bcl\u20102."

Inhibition of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a member of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, is a well-known strategy to overcome MDR in cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency and ability of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to knockdown ABCB1 gene expression in adriamycin resistant (A2780/ADR) ovarian cancer cell line and evaluate the sensitivity changes to doxorubicin. Three single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the fourth and fifth exons of human ABCB1 gene were designed in this study. Expression level of ABCB1 was detected using quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) after co-transfection of all three sgRNAs into A2780/ADR cell line and subsequent antibiotic selection. Drug sensitivity to doxorubicin was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The results showed that CRISPR/Cas9 system could significantly reduce the expression of P-gp. The dramatic decline in ABCB1 gene expression was associated with increased sensitivity of cells transfected with sgRNAs to doxorubicin. Based on the results of this study, it is concluded that the CRISPR-based systems, used in the present study, effectively down-regulated the target gene and acted as an ideal and cost-effective tool for gene editing of A2780/ADR cell line resulting in restoration of nonmalignant phenotype."

The objective of this article is to describe the feasibility, acceptability, and quantitative stress-related outcomes of a 6-week pilot lifestyle intervention using guided imagery (GI) council in order to reduce risk factors for obesity-related disease. Seventeen urban, adolescents (12 females/5 males, 16 Latino, age 17\u2009\u00b1\u20091 years, grades 9\u201312, body mass index 22\u2009\u00b1\u20094) participated in the 6-week, after-school pilot intervention. The intervention consisted of three, 75-minute after-school sessions delivered weekly for 6 weeks. The 3 weekly sessions included 1 session each of nutrition education, physical activity education and practice, and GI delivered in council, a facilitated group process based on indigenous practices. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed by attendance and qualitative exit interview. Stress outcomes included salivary cortisol and perceived stress. The pilot intervention was found to be feasible to deliver in an after-school setting. The GI and council group format were well liked. A 31% reduction in salivary cortisol was observed following the stress-reduction GI sessions. Diurnal cortisol patterns did not change across the intervention, but change in perceived stress was correlated with change in cortisol awakening response. The intervention was feasible to deliver and highly acceptable. Acute reduction in salivary cortisol was seen following group GI, while no change was seen in daily cortisol patterns. These results support the development of a full 12-week intervention using GI council to reduce obesity-related disease risk."

The ability to knockdown individual genes selectively via this reverse genetic technique has allowed many researchers to rapidly uncover the biological roles of numerous genes within many organisms, by evaluation of loss-of-function phenotypes. In the major human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae , the predominant method used to reduce the function of targeted genes involves injection of double-stranded (dsRNA) into the hemocoel of the adult mosquito. While this method has been successful, gene knockdown in adults excludes the functional assessment of genes that are expressed and potentially play roles during pre-adult stages, as well as genes that are expressed in limited numbers of cells in adult mosquitoes. We describe a method for the injection of Serine Protease Inhibitor 2 ( SRPN2 ) dsRNA during the early pupal stage and validate SRPN2 protein knockdown by observing decreased target protein levels and the formation of melanotic pseudo-tumors in SRPN2 knockdown adult mosquitoes. This evident phenotype has been described previously for adult stage knockdown of SRPN2 function, and we have recapitulated this adult phenotype by SRPN2 knockdown initiated during pupal development. When used in conjunction with a dye-labeled dsRNA solution, this technique enables easy visualization by simple light microscopy of injection quality and distribution of dsRNA in the hemocoel."

However, the mechanism by which cartilage phenotype is specified remains unclarified. Core binding factor \u03b11 (Cbfa1) is an essential transcription factor for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation and has the ability to stimulate chondrocyte maturation in vitro. To understand the roles of Cbfa1 in chondrocytes during skeletal development, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress Cbfa1 or a dominant negative (DN)-Cbfa1 in chondrocytes under the control of a type II collagen promoter/enhancer. Both types of transgenic mice displayed dwarfism and skeletal malformations, which, however, resulted from opposite cellular phenotypes. Cbfa1 overexpression caused acceleration of endochondral ossification due to precocious chondrocyte maturation, whereas overexpression of DN-Cbfa1 suppressed maturation and delayed endochondral ossification. In addition, Cbfa1 transgenic mice failed to form most of their joints and permanent cartilage entered the endochondral pathway, whereas most chondrocytes in DN- Cbfa1 transgenic mice retained a marker for permanent cartilage. These data show that temporally and spatially regulated expression of Cbfa1 in chondrocytes is required for skeletogenesis, including formation of joints, permanent cartilages, and endochondral bones."

We have developed the MGB Eclipsee\u2122 Probe System, which is composed of the following elements: MGB Eclipse probes and primers, specially developed software for the design of probes and primers, a unique set of modified bases and a Microsoft Excel macro for automated genotyping, which ably solves, in large part, this challenge. Fluorogenic MGB Eclipse probes are modified oligo-nucleotides containing covalently attached duplex-stabilising dihydrocyclopyrroloindole tripeptide (DPI 3 ), the MGB ligand (MGB\u2122 is a trademark of Epoch Biosciences, Bothell, WA), which has the combined properties of allowing the use of short sequences and providing great mismatch discrimination. The MGB moiety prevents probe degradation during polymerase chain reaction (PCR), allowing the researcher to use real time data; alternatively, hybridisation can be accurately measured by a post-PCR two-colour melt curve analysis. Using MGB Eclipse probes and primers containing modified bases further enhances the analysis of difficult SNP targets. G- or C-rich sequences can be refractory to analysis due to Hoogsteen base pairing. Substitution of normal G with Epoch's modified G prevents Hoogsteen base pairing, allowing both superior PCR and probe-based analysis of GC-rich targets. The use of modified A and T bases allows better stabilisation by significantly increasing the T m of the oligonucleotides. Modified A creates A-T base pairs that have a stability slightly lower than a G-C base pair, and modified T creates T-A base pairs that have a stability about 30 per cent higher than the unmodified base pair. Together, the modified bases permit the use of short probes, providing good mismatch discrimination and primers that allow PCR of refractory targets. The combination of MGB Eclipse probes and primers enriched with the MGB ligand and modified bases has allowed the analysis of refractory SNPs, where other methods have failed."

It can grow up to 2\u2009m, whereas the non- Bagarius sisorids only reach 10\u201330\u2009cm. Another outstanding characteristic of Bagarius species is the salmonids-like reddish flesh color. Both body size and flesh color are interesting questions in science and also valuable features in aquaculture that worth of deep investigations. Bagarius species therefore are ideal materials for studying body size evolution and color depositions in fish muscles, and also potential organisms for extensive utilization in Asian freshwater aquaculture. In a combination of Illumina and PacBio sequencing technologies, we de novo assembled a 571-Mb genome for the giant devil catfish from a total of 153.4-Gb clean reads. The scaffold and contig N50 values are 3.1 and 1.6\u2009Mb, respectively. This genome assembly was evaluated with 93.4% of Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs completeness, 98% of transcripts coverage, and highly homologous with a chromosome-level-based genome of channel catfish ( Ictalurus punctatus ). We detected that 35.26% of the genome assembly is composed of repetitive elements. Employing homology, de novo, and transcriptome-based annotations, we annotated a total of 19,027 protein-coding genes for further use. In summary, we generated the first high-quality genome assembly of the giant devil catfish, which provides an important genomic resource for its future studies such as the body size and flesh color issues, and also for facilitating the conservation and utilization of this valuable catfish."

        "abstract": "Uncompromised by chronic disease\u2010related comorbidities, human umbilical cord blood (UCB) progenitor cells with high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDH hi cells) stimulate blood vessel regeneration after intra\u2010muscular transplantation. However, implementation of cellular therapies using UCB ALDH hi cells for critical limb ischemia, the most severe form of severe peripheral artery disease, is limited by the rarity (<0.5%) of these cells. Our goal was to generate a clinically\u2010translatable, allogeneic cell population for vessel regenerative therapies, via ex vivo expansion of UCB ALDH hi cells without loss of pro\u2010angiogenic potency. Purified UCB ALDH hi cells were expanded >18\u2010fold over 6\u2010days under serum\u2010free conditions. Consistent with the concept that ALDH\u2010activity is decreased as progenitor cells differentiate, only 15.1%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3% of progeny maintained high ALDH\u2010activity after culture. However, compared to fresh UCB cells, expansion increased the total number of ALDH hi cells (2.7\u2010fold), CD34 + /CD133 + cells (2.8\u2010fold), and hematopoietic colony forming cells (7.7\u2010fold). Remarkably, injection of expanded progeny accelerated recovery of perfusion and improved limb usage in immunodeficient mice with femoral artery ligation\u2010induced limb ischemia. At 7 or 28 days post\u2010transplantation, mice transplanted with expanded ALDH hi cells showed augmented endothelial cell proliferation and increased capillary density compared to controls. Expanded cells maintained pro\u2010angiogenic mRNA expression and secreted angiogenesis\u2010associated growth factors, chemokines, and matrix modifying proteins. Coculture with expanded cells augmented human microvascular endothelial cell survival and tubule formation under serum\u2010starved, growth factor\u2010reduced conditions. Expanded UCB\u2010derived ALDH hi cells represent an alternative to autologous bone marrow as an accessible source of pro\u2010angiogenic hematopoietic progenitor cells for the refinement of vascular regeneration\u2010inductive therapies.

The aim of the study was to determine the existence of oxidative stress and its possible consequences in female patients with CFS. Twenty-four women aged 15-45 who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for CFS with no comorbidities were recruited and were age matched to a control group of 19 healthy women. After conducting the routine laboratory tests, levels of the lipid oxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein oxidation protein carbonyl (CO) were determined. The CFS group had higher levels of triglycerides ( p = 0.03), MDA ( p = 0.03) and CO ( p = 0.002) and lower levels of HDL cholesterol ( p = 0.001) than the control group. There were no significant differences in the levels of total protein, total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol. The CFS group had an unfavorable lipid profile and signs of oxidative stress induced damage to lipids and proteins. These results might be indicative of early proatherogenic processes in this group of patients who are otherwise at low risk for atherosclerosis. Antioxidant treatment and life style changes are indicated for women with CFS, as well as closer observation in order to assess the degree of atherosclerosis."

A total of 90 healthy SD rats were selected and divided into the treatment group, the model control group and the normal control group with 30 rats in each group. Rats in the treatment and model control groups were used to construct CCI model. The control group was treated with sham surgery. The model control group was not treated after surgery. The treatment group was treated with pregabalin on the 8th day after operation. Behavioral experiments were performed to measure mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL). The expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 was detected by ELISA kit and expression of Hdac2 and Inpp5f mRNA was detected by RT-qPCR. Before treatment, compared with the normal control group, MWT and TWL values of the treatment and model control groups were significantly decreased (P<0.05). At different time-points after treatment, MWT and TWL were higher in the treatment group than in the model control group and were lower than in the normal control group. At 21 days after operation, the levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in the model control and treatment groups were higher than those in the normal control group (P<0.05). The expression level of Hdac2 was higher in the treatment group than in the normal control group (P<0.05). The expression level of Inpp5f mRNA in the treatment and normal control groups was significantly higher than that in the model control group (P<0.05), but the expression level of Inpp5f mRNA in the treatment group was lower than that in the normal control group (P<0.05). Therefore, pregabalin can effectively relieve neuropathic pain in CCI rats, and its efficacy is related to Hdac2 and Inpp5f. Our study provides reference for clinical treatment of neuropathic pain induced by CCI."

We aimed to clarify the safety and effects of WT1 peptide vaccination in combination with imatinib therapy for a CML patient. A 51 year-old male with CML in CP, who showed a resistance against imatinib therapy for 2.5 years, began to be treated with 9mer modified-type WT1 peptides in combination with standard dose of imatinib. Although every 2-week-administration of WT1 peptides for 22 weeks did not show definite effects on the quantification of bcr-abl transcripts, by changing the administration from every 2 weeks to 4 weeks bcr-abl transcripts decreased remarkably. After 11 months of every 4-week-administration of the peptides and 12 months post cessation of the peptides bcr-abl transcripts achieved to the level below detection by RQ/RT-PCR (complete molecular response). WT1/MHC tetramer + CD8 + CTLs, which appeared after the second administration of WT1 peptides and remained more than 15 in number among 10 6 CD8 + T cells throughout the administration of WT1 peptides, are still present in the blood on 14th month post cessation of the peptides. An in vitro study as to the cytotoxicity of lymphocytes induced by mixed lymphocyte peptide culture demonstrated that cultured lymphocytes possessed cytotoxicity against WT1 expressing leukemia cells and the cytotoxicity was WT1-specific and MHC class I restricted. The present study showed that WT1 peptide vaccination in combination with TKI is feasible and effective in the therapy for imatinib-resistant CML."

        "abstract": "The current level of industrialization has generated many challenges worldwide, including ecological hazards, climate change, and the overuse of non-renewable natural resources, thereby creating an increasing demand for achieving the goal of the Triple Bottom Line (TBL). In this regard, Industry 4.0 can be used as a crunch point to contribute to the production process that can help achieve sustainable development. While the Malaysian government proposed the \u201cIndustry4ward\u201d approach to enhance technological adoption, there is scarce empirical evidence in the literature that validates SMEs for Industry 4.0. Using Dynamic Capability View (DCV), this study proposes a framework that includes core determinants like top management commitment, supply chain integration, and IT infrastructure, that can significantly influence Industry 4.0 implementation toward achieving TBL sustainability. Employing simple random sampling, the study adopted a quantitative approach based on 199 useable respondent's feedback collected through a survey questionnaire of 900 employees from Malaysian SMEs. The statistical analysis was performed using Structural Equation Modeling (Partial Least Square, SmartPLS 3.3.2). The results show that top management and IT infrastructure significantly impact Industry 4.0 implementation and sustainability. In contrast, the analysis also demonstrates that supply chain integration is insignificant to Industry 4.0 implementation in SMEs. The findings also indicate that the relationship between the determinants of Industry 4.0 and TBL sustainability can be mediated by the \u201ceffective implementation\u201d of Industry 4.0. The study highlights the practical consequences of the role and use of the determinants in Industry 4.0 implementation. Its findings help managers and policy-makers to optimize value creation to achieve sustainable development goals. Focusing only on Malaysian manufacturing SMEs may restrict the generalization of the study; thus, a benchmarking analysis from other industrial settings is encouraged. The questionnaire-based survey is a further limitation of the study. Industry 4.0, Dynamic Capabilities, Top management commitment, Supply chain integration, IT infrastructure, TBL sustainability."

        "abstract": "Aspergillus niger forms aerial hyphae and conidiophores after a period of vegetative growth. The hyphae within the mycelium of A. niger are divided by septa. The central pore in these septa allows for cytoplasmic streaming. Here, we studied inter- and intra-compartmental streaming of the reporter protein GFP in A. niger. Expression of the gene encoding nuclear targeted GFP from the gpdA or glaA promoter resulted in strong fluorescence of nuclei within the vegetative hyphae and weak fluorescence in nuclei within the aerial structures. These data and nuclear run on experiments showed that gpdA and glaA are higher expressed in the vegetative mycelium when compared to aerial hyphae, conidiophores and conidia. Notably, gpdA or glaA driven expression of the gene encoding cytosolic GFP resulted in strongly fluorescent vegetative hyphae and aerial structures. Apparently, GFP streams from vegetative hyphae into aerial structures. This was confirmed by monitoring fluorescence of photo-activatable GFP (PA-GFP). In contrast, PA-GFP did not stream from aerial structures to vegetative hyphae. Streaming of PA-GFP within vegetative hyphae or within aerial structures of A. niger occurred at a rate of 10\u201315 \u03bcm s -1 . Taken together, these results not only show that GFP streams from the vegetative mycelium to aerial structures but it also indicates that its encoding RNA is not streaming. Absence of RNA streaming would explain why distinct RNA profiles were found in aerial structures and the vegetative mycelium by nuclear run on analysis and micro-array analysis."

        "abstract": "Induced premature menopause accelerates the rate of body composition changes (decrease in skeletal muscle mass and increase in fat mass) and deteriorating physical function. However, few studies have focused on the impact of premature natural menopause. This study aimed to investigate the impact of age at natural menopause (ANM) on body composition and physical function in elderly women. Using data from the Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Study, 765 community-dwelling elderly women aged 70 to 85\u200ayears who experienced natural menopause were recruited in this study. Body composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Physical function was evaluated by grip strength, the timed up and go test (TUG), and the short physical performance battery (SPPB). Participants were categorized into 4 groups according to their ANM: <40 (premature natural menopause, PNM), 40 to 44 (early natural menopause, ENM), 45 to 54 (normal menopause, NM), and \u226555 (late menopause, LM) years. There were no significant differences in the body composition parameters, such as the appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (PNM: 5.90\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.90 vs ENM: 5.91\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.70 vs NM: 5.85\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.73 vs LM: 5.90\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.75, kg/m 2 , P =\u200a.75) and trunk fat mass index (PNM: 19.4\u200a\u00b1\u200a3.9 vs ENM: 19.9\u200a\u00b1\u200a4.4 vs NM: 19.9\u200a\u00b1\u200a3.9 vs LM: 20.0\u200a\u00b1\u200a3.8, %, P =\u200a.87) between the groups. In the physical function evaluation, there was no significant difference between the groups in grip strength (PNM: 19.8\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.6 vs ENM: 20.3\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.4 vs NM: 20.6\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.2 vs LM: 20.6\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.4, kg, P =\u200a.53). However, in the TUG (PNM: 11.8\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.4 vs ENM: 10.3\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.3 vs NM: 10.6\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.1 vs LM: 10.2\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.3, seconds, P <\u200a.01) and SPPB (PNM: 10.0\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.2 vs ENM: 10.5\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.2 vs NM: 10.6\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.1 vs LM: 10.8\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.2, points, P <\u200a.05), the PNM group showed significantly lower values than the other groups did. There was no difference in physical function between the groups except the PNM. Premature natural menopause did not affect the body composition in elderly women but was associated with physical function deterioration. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the prevention of the physical function deterioration caused by premature natural menopause in elderly women."

This study aimed to compare the percentage of collagen, the presence of inflammation, the density of chimase and tryptase mast cells, the area and density of lingual salivary gland acini in autopsied individuals with and without (CD). We analyzed 400 autopsy reports performed in a tertiary public hospital from 1999 to 2015 and selected all the cases in which tongue fragments were collected (27 cases), 12 with chronic CD without megaesophagus (CH) and 15 without CD (non-chagasic - NC). The histological sections of the tongue were stained by Picrosirius red for collagen evaluation and Hematoxylin-eosin for morphometric evaluation of salivary gland acini and inflammation. Anti-chimase and anti-tryptase antibodies were used for the immunohistochemical evaluation of mast cells. The chagasic patients presented higher volume and lower density of salivary glands acini. There was no difference in the collagen percentage, inflammation and density of mast cell chymase and tryptase between the groups. Although we did not observe a significant difference between the groups regarding the collagen percentage, inflammatory process and mast cell density, our results suggest that even without megaesophagus, chagasic patients present hypertrophy of the lingual salivary glands and lower acinar density probably due to mechanisms independent of the esophagus-glandular stimulus."

We performed this meta-analysis to synthesize the results of different clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alectinib. A search of 3 databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, was performed from the inception of each database through September 5, 2017. We have pooled the overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate, progression-free survival, and intracranial ORR to evaluate the efficacy of alectinib. Discontinuation rate, rate of dose reduction or interruption due to adverse events as well as the incidence of several adverse events were aggregated to evaluate its safety. A total of 8 studies with 626 patients have been included in our study. The pooled efficacy parameters are as follows: ORR 70% (95% CI: 57% to 82%), disease control rate 88% (95% CI: 82% to 94%), progression-free survival 9.36 months (95% CI: 7.38% to 11.34%), and intracranial ORR 52% (95% CI: 45% to 59%). ALK inhibitor-na\u00efve patients tend to have better responses than crizotinib-pretreated patients. The aggregate discontinuation rate is 7% (95% CI: 4% to 10%), and the pooled rate of dose reduction or interruption is 33% (95% CI: 24% to 42%). The incidences of most adverse events were relatively low, while the incidences of 2 frequently reported adverse events, myalgia (18%) and anemia (25%), were even higher than with the first-generation ALK inhibitor crizotinib. Generally, alectinib is a drug with preferable efficacy and tolerable adverse effects, and it is suitable for the treatment of intracranial metastases."

In this study, we report coexpression of TBX18 and WT1 in the majority of epicardial cells during mouse embryonic epicardial development. Furthermore, we describe a convenient chemically defined, immunogen-free, small molecule-based method for generating TBX18 + /WT1 + epicardial-like cell populations with 80% homogeneity from human pluripotent stem cells by modulation of the WNT and retinoic acid signaling pathways. These epicardial-like cells exhibited characteristic epicardial cell morphology following passaging and differentiation into functional SMCs or cardiac fibroblast-like cells.

        "abstract": "This study aimed to propose a new ground truth ultrasound imaging method and to confirm its efficacy when applied to side lobe suppression filtering. Using a computer simulation, we synthesized a side lobe-free image (i.e., with no side lobe whatsoever) by separating the main and side lobe signals in the construction of point target, speckled cyst, and pseudo-kidney images. During signal processing, we assessed the quality of the filtered image by comparing it with a ground truth image (i.e., the main lobe image). We examined the effect of reducing the side lobe by applying aperture apodization, side lobe estimation and reduction filtering, and minimum variance beamforming, which are widely used as side lobe suppression techniques. Despite the drawback of decreased resolution, the commonly used apodization method increases the contrast, which improves ultrasound image quality and enables a better diagnosis. Although side lobe estimation and reduction filtering and minimum variance beamforming are demanding in terms of computational resources, they can considerably improve ultrasound images. Compounding of ultrasound images processed by various signal processing methods increases the resolution and contrast, while reducing the speckle noise. Although it appears that the proposed method can only be used for computer-generated radiofrequency data, this method can improve ultrasound image quality by identifying the characteristics of signal processing filters for side lobe suppression and applying appropriately adjusted filters to in vivo human imaging data."

        "abstract": "Communication between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and their environment is essential for the development and progression of HCC. Exosomes, which are microvesicles secreted by a number of cell types, are carriers of intercellular information and regulate the tumour microenvironment. Studies have demonstrated that exosomes are involved in the communication between HCC cells, endothelial cells and stem cells, and that they serve important roles in the metastasis and invasion, immune evasion and immunotherapy of HCC. In addition, the mechanism of HCC-derived exosome-mediated microRNA (miRNA) transfer is important in the environmental modulation of HCC growth and progression. As exosomes can be used for detecting and monitoring HCC, they can potentially serve as specific biomarkers for early-stage tumours and the tumour metastasis of HCC. Moreover, mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes can be transfected with miRNAs to inhibit HCC development. Therefore, as nucleic acid delivery vehicles, exosomes show a tremendous potential for effective treatment against HCC. In the present review, recent advances in our understanding of the source, composition and function of exosomes in HCC, and their potential value in the early diagnosis and treatment of HCC, are summarized."

They are oxidation products of cholesterol and may be differentially metabolised in subcellular compartments and in biological fluids. New analytical methods are needed to improve our understanding of oxysterol trafficking and the molecular interplay between the cellular compartments required to maintain cholesterol/oxysterol homeostasis. Here we describe a method for isolation of oxysterols using solid phase extraction and quantification by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, applied to tissue, cells and mitochondria. We analysed five monohydroxysterols; 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol, 7\u03b1-hydroxycholesterol, 7 ketocholesterol and three dihydroxysterols 7\u03b1-24(S)dihydroxycholesterol, 7\u03b1-25dihydroxycholesterol, 7\u03b1-27dihydroxycholesterol by LC-MS/MS following reverse phase chromatography. Our new method, using Triton and DMSO extraction, shows improved extraction efficiency and recovery of oxysterols from cellular matrix. We validated our method by reproducibly measuring oxysterols in mouse brain tissue and showed that mice fed a high fat diet had significantly lower levels of 24S/25diOHC, 27diOHC and 7ketoOHC. We measured oxysterols in mitochondria from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and highlight the importance of rapid cell isolation to minimise effects of handling and storage conditions on oxysterol composition in clinical samples. In addition, in vitro cell culture systems, of THP-1 monocytes and neuronal-like SH-SH5Y cells, showed mitochondrial-specific oxysterol metabolism and profiles were lineage specific. In summary, we describe a robust and reproducible method validated for improved recovery, quantitative linearity and detection, reproducibility and selectivity for cellular oxysterol analysis. This method enables subcellular oxysterol metabolism to be monitored and is versatile in its application to various biological and clinical samples. \u2022 New method for extraction and quantification of mono and dihydroxysterols from mitochondria. \u2022 Method offers high sensitivity and selectivity allowing quantification of oxysterols at \u22655pg.\u03bcl \u22121 . \u2022 Successful application to tissue, primary cells and cell lines. \u2022 Common oxysterol metabolites are present in blood and brain cell mitochondria.

Clinical trials have proposed a useful effect of helminth infections on improvement of inflammatory disorders. In this study, we investigated the immunomodulatory effect of Syphacia obvelata infection to induce intestinal tolerance in C57BL/6 mice. Mice were infected through the cagemates with self-infected BALB/c mice. Four weeks post-infection, expression levels of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-17, and IL-10 were assessed in the supernatant of mesenteric lymph node (MLN) culture. Foxp3 + Treg were measured in MLN cells by flow cytometry. In the S. obvelata -infected group, the percentage of Tregs (5.2\u00b10.4) was significantly higher than the control (3.6\u00b10.5) ( P <0.05). The levels of IL-10 (55.3\u00b12.2 vs 35.2\u00b13.2), IL-17 (52.9\u00b13.8 vs 41\u00b11.8), IFN-\u03b3 (44.8\u00b14.8 vs 22.3\u00b12.3) and TNF-\u03b1 (71.1\u00b15.8 vs 60.1\u00b13.3) were significantly increased in infected mice compared to the control group ( P <0.05).

The right atrial appendage tissue field action potential duration (fAPD) was measured by microelectrode arrays. RAP successfully induced AF. Myocardial fibrosis was more severe in Groups B and C and less severe in Group D. Protein expression of MMP-9 was strongly positive in Groups B and C and weakly positive in Group D. The fAPD was significantly decreased in Groups B and C, but the decrease in Group D was not significant.

Microorganisms, especially bacteria and fungi, are well studied for their ability to produce enzymes complex unlike yeast. Yeast strain isolated from mushroom farm was studied for simultaneous production of cellulase, xylanase and ligninase enzymes using lignocellulose waste as substrates. A response surface methodology (RSM) involving Box-Behnken design (BBD) was used to investigate interaction between variables (moisture content, inoculum size, initial pH, incubation time) that affect enzyme production. Crude filtrate was partially purified and characterised. Yeast strain identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae SCPW 17 was finally studied. Evaluation of lignocellulose waste for enzyme complex production revealed corn cob to be most effective substrate for cellulase, xylanase and ligninase production with enzyme activity of 17.63 \u00b1 1.45 U/gds, 29.35 \u00b1 1.67 U/gds and 150.75 \u00b1 2.01 \u03bcmol/min respectively.

However, whether CEA levels are associated with histologic subtype, EGFR mutations, and ALK fusion remain largely unclear. Preoperative serum CEA levels, postoperative histologic subtypes, and statuses of EGFR mutations and ALK fusion protein were retrospectively assessed in 442 patients with completely resected lung adenocarcinoma treated from January 2014 to December 2015 at Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, People\u2019s Republic of China. EGFR mutations were found in 69.9% (309/442) of lung adenocarcinoma patients, and ALK fusion protein in 4.5% (20/442). EGFR mutations occurred more frequently in the lepidic subtype ( P =0.001). High preoperative serum CEA levels (CEA >20 ng/mL) were independently associated with EGFR mutations ( P <0.001). Moreover, in patients with CEA levels of 21\u201349 ng/mL, the EGFR mutation rate was 88.2%, which was higher compared to those obtained in the other subgroups. In addition, all specimens were invasive adenocarcinoma, with lepidic (18.6%), papillary (15.4%), acinar (52.7%), solid (9.7%), micropapillary (3.2%), and mucinous predominant (0.4%) subtypes; CEA levels in patients with the solid subtype were higher than those of other histologic subtypes ( P =0.001). Preoperative serum CEA levels can serve as a reference marker to identify the histologic subtype, and EGFR mutation or ALK fusion protein status, in lung adenocarcinoma patients. Moreover, histological subtypes could also predict EGFR mutations."

This study aimed to examine reliability and validity of an abbreviated version of the oral impact of daily performance (OIDP) questionnaire and to analyse the interrelationship among OIDP scores, socio-demographic characteristics and oral health status in Uganda. 1146 adolescents (mean age 15.8, response rate 87%) attending secondary schools in Kampala (urban) and Lira (rural) completed a survey instrument designed to measure subjective oral health indicators including the eight-item OIDP frequency scores. A clinical examination was conducted among 372 students (mean age 16.3, response rate 72%) and caries was assessed following the World Health Organisation criteria (1997). 62% of the students experienced at least one oral impact during the 6 months preceding the survey. Cronbach's alpha for the OIDP frequency items was 0.91 and the corrected item-total correlation ranged from 0.62 to 0.75. Discriminant and construct validity were demonstrated in that the OIDP scores varied systematically in the expected direction with missing teeth and self-report indicators of oral health status, respectively. Socio-demographics and dental attendance did not predict OIDP through interaction with clinical indicators but varied systematically and independently with OIDP frequency scores in the multivariate analysis. the OIDP frequency score have acceptable psychometric properties in the context of an oral health survey among Ugandan adolescents. Some evidence of the importance of social and personal characteristics in shaping adolescents' responses to oral disorders was provided."

From October 2014 to June 2015, 42 patients who underwent a TKA in Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital were divided into a guide plate group (GPG, 21 cases) and a traditional surgery group (TSG, 21 cases) using a random number table method. In the GPG group, a guide plate was designed and printed using preoperative three-dimensional measurements to plan and digitally simulate the operation. TSG cases were treated with the conventional method. Outcomes were obtained from the postoperative image examination and short-term follow-up. Operative time was 49.0 \u00b1 10.5 min for GPG, and 62.0 \u00b1 9.7 min in TSG.

Statistically significant differences were found between GPG and TSG in all measurements. A customized guide plate to create an accurate osteotomy in TKAs may be created using lower-extremity X-ray and knee CT images.

While previous work has shown that the biochemical identity of the matrix can alter the outgrowth of neurites in response to neurotrophins, the importance of the concentration of cell-adhesive ligands is unknown. Using engineered elastin-like protein matrices, we recently demonstrated a synergistic effect between matrix-bound cell-adhesive ligand density and soluble nerve growth factor treatment on neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglia. This synergism was mediated by Schwann cell-neurite contact through L1CAM. Cell-adhesive ligand density was also shown to alter the pathfinding behavior of dorsal root ganglion neurites in response to a gradient of nerve growth factor. While more cell-adhesive matrices promoted neurite outgrowth, less cell-adhesive matrices promoted more faithful neurite pathfinding. These studies emphasize the importance of considering both matrix biochemistry and neurotrophic factors when designing biomaterials for peripheral nerve regeneration."

Full-length pCLEC4G cDNA encodes a type II transmembrane protein of 290 amino acids. pCLEC4G gene has the same gene structure as the human and the predicted bovine, canis, mouse and rat CLEC4G genes with nine exons. A multi-species-conserved site at the extreme 3\u2032-untranslated region of CLEC4G mRNAs was predicted to be targeted by microRNA miR-350 in domesticated animals and by miR-145 in primates, respectively. We detected pCLEC4G mRNA expression in liver, lymph node and spleen tissues. We also identified a series of sequential intermediate products of pCLEC4G pre-mRNA during splicing from pig liver. The previously unidentified porcine CD23 cDNA containing the complete coding region was subsequently cloned and found to express in spleen, thymus and lymph node. Furthermore, we compared the chromosomal regions syntenic to the human cluster of genes CD23/CLEC4G/DC-SIGN/L-SIGN in representative mammalian species including primates, domesticated animal, rodents and opossum. The L-SIGN homologues do not exist in non-primates mammals.

        "abstract": "The prevalence of mania among >65-year-olds ranges from 0.1% to 0.4% and its treatment is a particular challenge for clinicians. Although lithium is the treatment of choice for bipolar disorder (BD), its use in elderly population was recently questioned. This study provides a comprehensive review of literature on the efficacy and tolerability of lithium as a pharmacologic treatment for mania in elderly BD patients. We conducted a systematic review, based on PRISMA guidelines, of articles published between 1970 and August 2016 and indexed in the following databases: EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library Databases and PsycINFO. The key words \u201cage\u201d, \u201clate-life\u201d, \u201cgeriatric\u201d, \u201celderly\u201d, and \u201colder\u201d were combined with words indicating pharmacologic treatments, such as lithium and other mood stabilizers and with the diagnostic terms \u201cbipolar disorder\u201d and \u201cmania\u201d. Fifteen out of 196 retrieved studies met our inclusion criteria. Seven studies evaluated both the efficacy and tolerability of lithium treatment in elderly BD patients; a further three evaluated only the efficacy and five assessed tolerability. Only limited data on the treatment of elderly BD patients are available, but evidence suggests that lithium is effective and tolerated in this subgroup of patients and thus should remain a first-line drug. It seems to be more effective at lower doses and close monitoring of plasma concentrations is necessary."

        "abstract": "\u2022 An outbreak of severe diarrhea was caused by Cryptosporidium parvum IIdA19G1 in dairy calves. \u2022 Concurrence of rotavirus was present, but not as a significant cause of diarrhea in the investigation. \u2022  Cryptosporidium parvum infection was associated with the occurrence of watery diarrhea in calves. \u2022  Cryptosporidium ryanae and Cryptosporidium bovis infections were associated with the occurrence of moderate diarrhea. An outbreak of severe diarrhea was caused by Cryptosporidium parvum IIdA19G1 in dairy calves. Concurrence of rotavirus was present, but not as a significant cause of diarrhea in the investigation.  Cryptosporidium parvum infection was associated with the occurrence of watery diarrhea in calves.  Cryptosporidium ryanae and Cryptosporidium bovis infections were associated with the occurrence of moderate diarrhea. Neonatal diarrhea is one of the most important syndromes in dairy cattle. Among enteropathogens, Cryptosporidium spp. are primary causes of diarrhea, but outbreaks due to cryptosporidiosis are rarely reported in cattle. From January to April in 2016, severe diarrhea was observed in over 400 neonatal dairy calves on a large dairy farm in Jiangsu Province of East China. Approximately 360 calves died due to watery diarrhea despite antibiotic therapy. In this study, 18 fecal specimens were collected from seriously ill calves on this farm during the diarrhea outbreak, and analysed for common enteropathogens by enzymatic immunoassay (EIA). In a post-outbreak investigation, 418 and 1372 specimens collected from animals of various age groups were further analysed for rotavirus and Cryptosporidium spp. by EIA and PCR, respectively, to assess their roles in the occurrence of diarrhea on the farm. Cryptosporidium spp. were genotyped using established techniques. Initial EIA tests showed that 15/18 seriously ill calves during the outbreak were positive for Cryptosporidium parvum , while 8/18 were positive for rotavirus. The overall infection rate of Cryptosporidium in pre-weaned calves on the farm was 22.7%, with odds of the Cryptosporidium infection during the outbreak 4.4\u201323.5 times higher than after the outbreak. Four Cryptosporidium spp. were identified after the outbreak including C. parvum ( n =\u202f79), Cryptosporidium ryanae ( n =\u202f48), Cryptosporidium bovis ( n =\u202f31), and Cryptosporidium andersoni ( n =\u202f3), with co-infections of multiple species being detected in 34 animals. Infection with C. parvum (73/79) was found in the majority of calves aged \u22643\u202fweeks, consistent with the age of ill calves during the outbreak. All C. parvum isolates were identified as subtype IIdA19G1. In the post-outbreak investigation, C. parvum infection was associated with the occurrence of watery diarrhea in pre-weaned calves, C. ryanae infection was associated with moderate diarrhea in both pre- and post-weaned calves, while no association was identified between rotavirus infection and the occurrence of diarrhea. Results of logistic regression analysis further suggested that C. bovis infection might also be a risk factor for moderate diarrhea in calves. Thus, we believe this is the first report of a major outbreak of severe diarrhea caused by C. parvum IIdA19G1 in dairy calves. More attention should be directed toward preventing the dissemination of this virulent subtype in China."

        "title": "Consistent Pulmonary Drug Delivery with Whole Lung Deposition Using the Aerosphere Inhaler: A Review of the Evidence",
        "abstract": "Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) are one of the most common device types for delivering inhaled therapies. However, there are several technical challenges in development and drug delivery of these medications. In particular, suspension-based MDIs are susceptible to suspension heterogeneity, in vitro drug\u2013drug interactions, and patient handling errors, which may all affect drug delivery. To overcome these challenges, new formulation approaches are required. The Aerosphere TM inhaler, formulated using co-suspension delivery technology, combines drug crystals with porous phospholipid particles to create stable, homogenous suspensions that dissolve once they reach the airways. Two combination therapies using this technology have been developed for the treatment of COPD: glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate (GFF MDI; dual combination) and budesonide/glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate (BGF MDI; triple combination). Here, we review the evidence with a focus on studies assessing dose delivery, lung deposition, and effects on airway geometry. In vitro assessments have demonstrated that the Aerosphere inhaler provides consistent dose delivery, even in the presence of simulated patient handling errors. Combination therapies delivered with this technology also show a consistent fine particle fraction (FPF) and an optimal particle size distribution for delivery to the central and peripheral airways even when multiple drugs are delivered via the same inhaler. Studies using gamma scintigraphy and functional respiratory imaging have demonstrated that GFF MDI is effectively deposited in the central and peripheral airways, and provides clinically meaningful benefits on airway volume and resistance throughout the lung. Overall, studies suggest that the Aerosphere inhaler, formulated using co-suspension delivery technology, may offer advantages over traditional formulations, including consistent delivery of multiple components across patient handling conditions, optimal particle size and FPF, and effective delivery to the central and peripheral airways. Future studies may provide additional evidence to further characterize the clinical benefits of these technical improvements in MDI drug delivery."

        "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that the association between dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and coronary artery disease risk varies according to food sources. How SFAs from butter and cheese influence HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC), a key process in reverse cholesterol transport, is currently unknown. In a predefined secondary analysis of a previously published trial, we have examined how diets rich in SFAs from either cheese or butter influence HDL-mediated CEC, compared with diets rich in either monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In a randomized crossover controlled consumption trial, 46 men and women with abdominal obesity consumed 5 isocaloric diets, each for 4 wk. Two diets were rich in SFAs either from cheese (CHEESE) or butter (BUTTER) [12.4\u201312.6% of energy (%E) as SFAs, 32%E as fat, 52%E as carbohydrates]. In 2 other diets, SFAs (5.8%E) were replaced with either MUFAs from refined olive oil (MUFA) or PUFAs from corn oil (PUFA). Finally, a lower fat and carbohydrate diet was used as a control (5.8%E as SFAs, 25.0%E as fat, 59%E as carbohydrates; CHO). Post-diet HDL-mediated CEC was determined ex vivo using radiolabelled J774 macrophages incubated with apolipoprotein B\u2013depleted serum from the participants. Mean (\u00b1SD) age was 41.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.2 y, and waist circumference was 107.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.5 cm in men and 94.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.4 cm in women. BUTTER and MUFA increased HDL-mediated CEC compared with CHEESE (+4.3%, P =\u00a00.026 and +4.7%, P =\u00a00.031, respectively). Exploring the significant diet \u00d7 sex interaction ( P =\u00a00.044) revealed that the increase in HDL-mediated CEC after BUTTER compared with CHEESE was significant among men (+6.0%, P =\u00a00.047) but not women (+2.9%, P =\u00a00.19), whereas the increase after MUFA compared with CHEESE was significant among women (+9.1%, P =\u00a00.008) but not men (\u20130.6%, P =\u00a00.99). These results provide evidence of a food matrix effect modulating the impact of dairy SFAs on HDL-mediated CEC with potential sex-related differences that deserve further investigation. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02106208."

However, less work has been undertaken to assess the sexual frequency and its predictors in migrants. This study seeks to explore which factors were related to sexual frequency in migrants and how the association varies with different levels of sexual frequency. A total of 10,834 men and 4,928 women aged 20\u201349 years from 5 cities in China were enrolled by multi-stage sampling during August 2013\u2013August\u00a02015. Sexual frequency among migrants was determined by asking: How many times have you had sexual intercourse with a man/woman in the past 30 days? In this study, sexual frequency with an average age of 38.28 years was 5.06 (95% CI 5.01\u20135.11) time per month. Negative binomial showed that male gender, younger age, earlier age of sexual debut, masturbation, more knowledge of sexual and reproductive health, longer time together with a spouse, and higher school education and incomes were predictors of increased sexual frequency in migrants. Communicating with sexual partners frequently had the largest effect on sexual frequency compared with occasional communicating ( \u03b2 =\u00a00.2419, incidence rate ratio\u00a0= 1.27, 95% CI 1.23\u20131.31). In the quantile regression, months of cohabitation ( \u03b2 = 0.0999, 95% CI 0.08\u20130.12), frequent sexual communication ( \u03b2 = 0.4534, 95% CI\u00a00.39\u20130.52), and masturbation ( \u03b2 = 0.2168, 95% CI 0.14\u20130.30) were positively related to lower levels of sexual frequency. Interestingly, migrants who had low and high sexual frequency would be affected in opposite directions by the knowledge of sexual and reproductive health. Clinicians can more understand the relationship between sexual frequency and its factors that can as the symptom basis of sexually-related diseases. The present findings indicate that specific demographic, socioeconomic, and epidemiological characteristics influenced sexual frequency among migrants. Sexual communication as the largest effect predictor to sexual frequency should be paid more attention to, to improve sexual activity of migrants. Zhang J, Wu J, Li Y, et\u00a0al.

In this study, a self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system of buckwheat flavonoids was prepared for enhancing its antioxidant activity and oral bioavailability. A nanoemulsion of buckwheat flavonoids was developed and characterized, and its antioxidant, in vitro release, and in vivo bioavailability were determined. The nanoemulsion was optimized by the central composite design response surface experiment, and its particle size, polymer dispersity index (PDI), zeta potential, morphology, encapsulation efficiency, and stability were evaluated. The antioxidant activity was tested by measuring its 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging activity, hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, and superoxide anion scavenging ability. In vitro release of buckwheat flavonoids nanoemulsion showed a higher cumulative release than the suspension, and the release fitting model followed the Ritger\u2013Peppas and Weibull models. The effective concentration of the nanoemulsion was evaluated in vivo using a Wistar rat model, and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of the buckwheat flavonoids nanoemulsion was 2.2-fold higher than that of the buckwheat flavonoid suspension. The C max of the nanoemulsion was 2.6-fold greater than that of the suspension. These results indicate that the nanoemulsion is a promising oral drug delivery system that can improve the oral bioavailability to satisfy the clinical requirements."

Degeneration of the unreplaced compartments has been reported in both mobile and fixed designs. When the revision is required, most of failed UKAs are converted to TKAs. Surgical challenges of the UKA revision, and outcomes of UKA converted to TKA are still debated in literature."

There are limited data investigating the correlation between surgeon experience and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) as well as procedure and traction times. To prospectively evaluate the relationship between surgeon experience and PROs after hip arthroscopic surgery for the treatment of FAI. Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. A total of 190 patients undergoing primary hip arthroscopic surgery for FAI were prospectively enrolled during a sports medicine fellowship\u2013trained surgeon\u2019s first 36 months of practice. A radiographic evaluation as well as PRO surveys including the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), and the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) were administered preoperatively and at 2 years postoperatively. Logistic regression as well as analysis of variance was performed to evaluate for correlations between surgical experience and PROs, procedure time, and traction time. Of the 190 patients, 168 (88%; mean age, 35.3 \u00b1 9.6 years; mean body mass index, 25.07 \u00b1 3.98) completed a 2-year follow-up and were included for analysis. The mean procedure time was 91.5 \u00b1 23.9 minutes, and the mean traction time was 54.0 \u00b1 17.7 minutes. Patients demonstrated significant improvements at 2 years after surgery for all PRO scores (mHHS, HOOS, and SF-12 physical component summary; P < .001), except the SF-12 mental component summary, which had no change ( P = .43). The procedure time significantly decreased after 70 cases, while the traction time continued to decrease until 110 cases ( R  2 = 0.99; P < .0001). There was no correlation between increasing case volume and 2-year PRO scores ( P > .2 for mHHS, HOOS, and SF-12). There was also no difference with increasing case volume and amount of improvement from preoperative to 2-year postoperative PRO scores for the SF-12 and HOOS. Case volume did not affect the complication rate, as this cohort experienced 4 minor cases of neurapraxia. Surgical efficiency in hip arthroscopic surgery for the treatment of FAI was maximized after 110 cases in this cohort. However, significant PRO improvements can be achieved early in a surgeon\u2019s practice prior to maximizing surgical efficiency."

This phenolic polymer plays a vital structural and protective role in the development and life of higher plants. Although the intricate mechanisms regulating lignification processes in vivo strongly impact the industrial valorization of many plant-derived products, the scientific community still has a long way to go to decipher them. In a simple three-step workflow, the dual labeling protocol presented herein enables bioimaging studies of actively lignifying zones of plant tissues. The first step consists in the metabolic incorporation of two independent chemical reporters, surrogates of the two native monolignols that give rise to lignin H- and G-units. After incorporation into growing lignin polymers, each reporter is then specifically labeled with its own fluorescent probe via a sequential combination of bioorthogonal SPAAC/CuAAC click reactions. Combined with lignin autofluorescence, this approach leads to the generation of three-color localization maps of lignin within plant cell walls by confocal fluorescence microscopy and provides precise spatial information on the presence or absence of active lignification machinery at the scale of plant tissues, cells and different cell wall layers."

We explored the epidemiology of different HPV types in men and women and their association with demographic and behavioural variables. We analysed data collected for the British National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, a cross-sectional survey undertaken in 1999\u20132001. Half of all sexually experienced male and female respondents aged 18\u201344\u2005years were invited to provide a urine sample. We tested 3123 stored urine samples using an in-house Luminex-based HPV genotyping system. HPV DNA was detected in 29.0% (95% CI 26.7% to 31.3%) of samples from women and 17.4% (95% CI 15.1% to 19.8%) from men. Any of 13 HR-HPV types was detected in 15.9% (95% CI 14.1% to 17.8%) of women and 9.6% (95% CI 8.0% to 11.6%) of men. HPV types 16/18 were found in 5.5% (95% CI 4.5% to 6.8%) of women and 3.0% (95% CI 2.1% to 4.3%) of men; and types 6/11 in 4.7% (95% CI 1.8% to 5.9%) of women and 2.2% (95% CI 1.5% to 3.1%) of men. In multivariate analysis, HR-HPV was associated with new partner numbers, in women with younger age, single status and partner concurrency, and in men with number of partners without using condom(s) and age at first intercourse. HPV DNA was detectable in urine of a high proportion of the sexually active British population. In both genders, HR-HPV was strongly associated with risky sexual behaviour. The minority of HPV infections were of vaccine types. It is important to monitor HPV prevalence and type distribution following the introduction of vaccination of girls."

Prevailing theories of tDCS focus on modulation of excitation-inhibition balance at the local stimulation location. However, network level effects are reported as well, and appear to depend upon differential underlying mechanisms. Here, we evaluated potential network-level effects of tDCS during the Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT) using convergent EEG- and fMRI-based connectivity approaches. Motor learning manifested as a significant ( p <.0001) shift from slow to fast responses and corresponded to a significant increase in beta-coherence ( p <.0001) and fMRI connectivity ( p <.01) particularly within the visual-motor pathway. Differential patterns of tDCS effect were observed within different parametric task versions, consistent with network models. Overall, these findings demonstrate objective physiological effects of tDCS at the network level that result in effective behavioral modulation when tDCS parameters are matched to network-level requirements of the underlying task."

MUTYH functionally cooperates with OGG1 that eliminates 8-oxodG derived from excessive reactive oxygen species production. MUTYH mutations have been linked to MUTYH associated polyposis syndrome (MAP), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by multiple colorectal adenomas. MAP patients show a greatly increased lifetime risk for gastrointestinal cancers. The cancer risk in mono-allelic carriers associated with one MUTYH mutant allele is controversial and it remains to be clarified whether the altered functions of this protein may have a pathophysiological involvement in other diseases besides familial gastrointestinal diseases. This review evaluates the role of MUTYH, focusing on current studies of human neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases different to colon polyposis and colorectal cancer. This will provide novel insights into the understanding of the molecular basis underlying MUTYH -related pathogenesis. Furthermore, we describe the association between MUTYH single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and different cancer and non-cancer diseases. We address the utility to increase our knowledge regarding MUTYH in the light of recent advances in the literature with the aim of a better understanding of the potential for identifying new therapeutic targets. Considering the multiple functions and interactions of MUTYH protein, its involvement in pathologies based on oxidative stress damage could be hypothesized. Although the development of extraintestinal cancer in MUTYH heterozygotes is not completely defined, the risk for malignancies of the duodenum, ovary, and bladder is also increased as well as the onset of benign and malignant endocrine tumors. The presence of MUTYH pathogenic variants is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in sporadic gastric cancer and in salivary gland secretory carcinoma, while its inhibition has been shown to reduce the survival of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells. Furthermore, some MUTYH SNPs have been associated with lung, hepatocellular and cervical cancer risk. An additional role of MUTYH seems to contribute to the prevention of numerous other disorders with an inflammatory/degenerative basis, including neurological and ocular diseases. Finally, it is interesting to note that MUTYH could be a new therapeutic target and future studies will shed light on its specific functions in the prevention of diseases and in the improvement of the chemo-sensitivity of cancer cells."

        "abstract": "It is of significance to evaluate central lymph node status in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), because it can decrease postoperative complications resulting from unnecessary prophylactic central lymph node dissection (CLND). Due to the low sensitivity and specificity of neck ultrasonography in the evaluation of central lymph node metastasis (CLNM), it is urgently required to find alternative biomarkers to predict CLNM in PTC patients, which is the main purpose of this study. RNA-sequencing datasets and clinical data of 506 patients with thyroid carcinoma from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were downloaded and analyzed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), which can independently predict CLNM in PTC. A nomogram predictive of CLNM was developed based on clinical characteristics and the identified miRNAs. Receiver operating characteristics curves were drawn to evaluate the predictive performance of the nomogram. Bioinformatics analyses, including target genes identification, functional enrichment analysis, and protein\u2013protein interaction network, were performed to explore the potential roles of the identified DEMs related to CLNM in PTC. A total of 316 PTC patients were included to identify DEMs. Two hundred thirty-seven (75%) PTC patients were randomly selected from the 316 patients as a training set, while the remaining 79 (25%) patients were regarded as a testing set for validation. Two DEMs, miRNA-146b-3p (HR: 1.327, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.135\u20131.551, P =\u200a.000) and miRNA-363\u20133p (HR: 0.714, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a0.528\u20130.966, P =\u200a.029), were significantly associated with CLNM. A risk score based on these 2 DEMs and calculating from multivariate logistic regression analysis, was significantly lower in N0 group over N1a group in both training (N0 vs N1a: 2.04\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.01 vs 2.73\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.61, P =\u200a.000) and testing (N0 vs N1a: 2.20\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.93 vs 2.79\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.68, P =\u200a.003) sets. The nomogram including risk score, age, and extrathyroidal extension (ETE) was constructed in the training set and was then validated in the testing set, which showed better prediction value than the other three predictors (risk score, age, and ETE) in terms of CLNM identification. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that 5 hub genes, SLC6A1 , SYT1 , COL19A1 , RIMS2 , and COL1A2 , might involve in pathways including extracellular matrix organization, ion transmembrane transporter activity, axon guidance, and ABC transporters. On the basis of this study, the nomogram including risk score, age, and ETE showed good prediction of CLNM in PTC, which has a potential to facilitate individualized decision for surgical plans."

Mutations distributed across different exons in non-invasive cases in contrast to single mutations restricted to exons 4 and 6 in invasive cases displayed a strong correlation to overexpression and phosphorylation status suggesting that higher copies of EGFR gene and mutations in exon 4&6 influence the invasive capacity of trophoblasts and can be used as a biomarker of invasion."

Many constrained or semi-constrained prostheses, using constrained liners (CLs) with a locking mechanism to capture the femoral head, were used to treat femoral neck fractures in patients with neurological disorders. We retrospectively studied a group of patients with Parkinson's disease and poliomyelitis who sustained femoral neck fractures and were treated by total hip arthroplasty using an L-MoM prosthesis. We retrospectively reviewed 12 hips in 12 patients who underwent large-diameter metal-on-metal (L-MoM) total hip replacement between May 2007 and October 2009. Eight of the 12 patients (8 hips; 66.7%) had Parkinson's disease and 4 patients (4 hips; 33.3%) were affected with poliomyelitis. The followup time was 5.2 years (range 3.6-6.0 years). At the latest followup, all the patients showed satisfactory clinical and radiographic results, with pain relief. No complications, such as dislocation or aseptic loosening occurred. We believe the use of L-MoM can diminish the rate of instability or dislocation, after operation. The L-MoM is an option for patients with Parkinson's disease and poliomyelitis with femoral neck fracture."

The present study aimed to explore the effect and underlying molecular mechanism of CLDN12 with regard to the malignant phenotype of SqCC. Firstly, the expression patterns of CLDN12 in SqCC tissues, lung adenocarcinoma tissues and histologically non-neoplastic lung epithelial tissues were investigated by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Additionally, associations between CLDN12 expression and clinicopathological indicators were examined in patients with SqCC. Furthermore, the impact of CLDN12 on the malignant phenotype of the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B in vitro was assessed using the Cell Counting kit-8 assay, Transwell assay and a wound-healing experiment. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were also used to detect the impact of CLDN12 on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of BEAS-2B cells. Tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) RNA interference was further utilized to determine the impact of the Tyk2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1) signaling pathway on the EMT of BEAS-2B cells. To conclude, it was indicated that the expression of CLDN12 was upregulated in SqCC tissues and was associated with the extent of lymphatic metastasis in patients with SqCC. Furthermore, CLDN12 promoted the EMT of human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro . The findings indicated that the induction of Tyk2/Stat1 signaling appears to be an important mechanism by which CLDN12 promotes the EMT of SqCC cells."

The methylation of the RUNX3 in the promoter region in PCa cells was detected by bisulfite-sequencing PCR (BSP). Following treatment of the PCa cells with DNA methylation transferase inhibitor 5-AZA-2\u02b9-deoxycytidine (AZA), the effect on methylation level and expression of RUNX3 were analyzed by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and BSP assays. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of the demethylated RUNX3 on proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis of PCa cells using CCK-8 and flow cytometry assays. Using the DNA methylation transferase (DNMT3b) knockout or overexpression models, the relationship between DNMT3b and RUNX3 methylation was further assessed by qRT-PCR, Western blot and methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The results indicated that the methylation level of RUNX3 in PCa cell lines was significantly higher than that of normal prostate epithelial (RWPE-1) cells. Furthermore, treatment with AZA not only promoted the demethylation of RUNX3 but also restored the mRNA and protein expression of RUNX3 , and the reactivation of expression of the later exhibited its anti-tumor effects through regulation of the cycle progression in PCa cells. Moreover, DNMT3b could regulate the expression level of RUNX3 by altering the DNA methylation of the RUNX3 in PCa cells. RUNX3 is hypermethylated in a panel of PCa cell lines; inhibition of DNA methylation of RUNX3 could restore its gene expression, which could promote its anticancer effect. Thus, RUNX3 may serve as a novel putative molecular target gene for PCa therapy."

We show that morin, used frequently as a model, is highly sensitive to oxidation with O 2 , by processes catalyzed by trace metal ions, that can be accelerated photochemically, although not involve generation of 1 O 2 . The structurally related chrysin is not susceptible to such photo\u2010accelerated oxidation with O 2 . Furthermore, chrysin is oxidized by H 2 O 2 only in the presence of a Mn\u2010tacn based catalyst, and does not undergo oxidation with O 2 as terminal oxidant. Chrysin mimics the behavior of raw cotton's chromophores in their catalyzed oxidation with H 2 O 2 , and is likely a mechanistically relevant model compound for the study of transition metal catalysts for dye bleaching catalysts under homogeneous conditions."

Six weeks after surgery, subjective refraction and defocus curve were made. Mean final residual refraction in spherical equivalent was +0.10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07\u00a0D in the LS-313MF30 group and +0.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10\u00a0D in the LS-313MF20 group. Defocus curve showed a different optical performance in intermediate/near distance depending on the IOL model. The medium addition IOL provided good visual acuity (VA) at far and intermediate distance up to 50\u00a0cms, and the high addition IOL provided better VA in near distance up to 25\u00a0cms. The high addition intraocular lens provides better visual acuity in the spatial range from infinity to the point close to 25\u00a0cm. The medium addition intraocular lens provides excellent visual acuity in far and intermediate vision.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TOP2A and ERCC1 genes were tested as prognostic and predictive factors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There are limited data about the clinical relevance of these genetic alterations in SCLC. We undertook this retrospective study to determine the influence of SNPs in TOP2A (rs34300454; rs13695; rs11540720) and ERCC1 (rs11615; rs3212986) genes on the efficiency and toxicity of chemotherapy with platinum and etoposide in SCLC Caucasian patients. The studied group included 103 Caucasian SCLC patients (65 male, 38 female, median age 65 \u00b17.5 years). Detailed clinical-demographical data were collected and response to treatment was monitored. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were analyzed using TaqMan hydrolyzing probes in real-time PCR technique on an Eco Illumina device. Patients with C/C genotype in rs13695 of the TOP2A gene had significantly lower risk of neutropenia during chemotherapy than C/T heterozygous patients ( p = 0.02, \u03c7\u00b2 = 5.51, OR = 2.676, 95% CI: 1.165\u20136.143).

Patients with \u22652 opioid dispensings starting in 2012 in a US administrative claims database were grouped into doctor/pharmacy shopping categories by number of providers and pharmacies used over 18\u00a0months: no shopping, minimal shopping, moderate shopping and severe shopping. Medical charts of opioid prescribers were reviewed to identify behaviors suggestive of misuse, diversion, abuse and/or addiction. Among 581,940 opioid users, 78% were classified as no shopping, 11% minimal shopping, 8% moderate shopping and 3% severe shopping. Almost 40% of severe shopping patients had no medical record documented behaviors (positive predictive value: 24.3%). Compared with no shopping, the odds ratio [OR] of \u22653 behaviors was 1.70 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50\u20135.78) for minimal shopping, 1.81 (95% CI 0.54\u20136.03) for moderate shopping, and 8.93 (95% CI 3.12\u201325.54) for severe shopping.

        "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (Maroteaux\u2013Lamy syndrome, MPS VI, OMIM 253200) is caused by mutations in the gene coding for N -acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (4-sulfatase, arylsulfatase B, ARSB, EC 3.1.6.12), a lysosomal enzyme involved in the degradation of dermatan sulfate (DS). The clinical presentation of MPS VI varies greatly with respect to age of onset and rate of disease progression. This report focuses on the attenuated form of MPS VI, which can go unrecognized for years and often presents with atypical signs or symptoms. We described a cohort of MPS VI patients ( n =\u20094) heterozygous for the p.Y210C mutation who had a significant osteoarticular involvement at the onset of their disease and who were diagnosed years or even decades later. We have also reviewed the literature ( n =\u200936). Two types of attenuated MPS VI phenotypes could be distinguished: osteoarticular and cardiac. The majority of MPS VI patients reported so far as relatively attenuated presented with an essentially osteoarticular phenotype associated with the p.Y210C mutation. Patients homozygous for the p.R152W mutation presented with a cardiac phenotype, which, despite fulfilling the generally used criteria for attenuated phenotype, may lead to fast disease progression and abrupt death. The knowledge of natural history and genotype\u2013phenotype correlation may help in developing a tailored therapy potentially using enzyme replacement therapy with substrate reduction therapy or chaperones."

        "abstract": "There has been no consensus in literature for the ideal flexor tendon repair technique. The results of zone 2 flexor tendon lacerations repaired primarily by 4 strand Modified Kessler core suture and epitendinous interlocking suture technique followed by Modified Kleinert protocol were investigated. 128 fingers of 89 patients who had flexor tendon laceration in zone 2 built the working group. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Strickland formula. A statistical analysis was made between Strickland scores and some parameters such as age, gender, follow-up time, co-existing injury existence, repair time, single or multiple finger injury, tendon rupture and the effect of FDS injury and repair. Excellent, good, fair, poor results were obtained from 71 (55.5%), 46 (35.9%), 8 (6.3%), 3 (2.3%) fingers, respectively. Time of the repair has a significant effect on the strickland scores. Surgery performed within the first 24\u00a0hours following the injury gave better results. 3 fingers (2.3%) had tendon ruptures. Existence of ruptures affected the results significantly. Co-existing injuries were found that they did not have any effect on the results. In the fingers in which both FDP and FDS tendons were lacerated, no significant relationship was found between only FDP repair, both FDP and FDS repair and single FDS slip repair. Additionally no significant relationships between follow-up time, gender, single or multiple finger injury and Strickland scores were observed. 13 fingers (10.1%) had PIP joint contracture above 20\u00b0. The low rupture rate (2.3%) and 91.4% \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018excellent\u2019 scoring rates in our series support the idea that modified Kessler 4-strand core suture and epitendinous interlocking suture repair combined with modified Kleinert protocol gives satisfactory results. Repair time is one of the most important factors affecting the functional results and surgery should not be delayed if there is an experienced surgeon available. Level IV, therapeutic study."

A left temporal cavernoma caused focal epilepsy facilitated by drawing, in an artist. Drawing triggered delta activity on left anterior temporal and orbito-frontal areas. These areas were activated by drawing and the left uncinate fasciculus connecting them was affected. Neuronal excessive discharges and hyper-synchrony may be facilitated by altered connectivity of different cortical areas. There are few studies in literature reporting drawing as a strong trigger of praxis-induced focal seizures. The aim of the present case report was describing a case of focal epilepsy with praxis induced EEG activation, due to a cavernoma, in the left middle anterior temporal lobe by using a multimodal approach. We combined video-EEG, showing that drawing increased a sustained monomorphic delta activity localized on left anterior temporal region (F7-T1a), diffusing to the vertex (Fz) and the fronto-polar electrodes (F3), with DTI data, showing that the left uncinate fasciculus, connecting the temporal pole to the orbitofrontal cortex, significantly differed from controls. fMRI confirmed that drawing increased activation in these areas. The congruence between findings supports the role of the left uncinated fasciculus linking the temporal lobe to the orbitofrontal cortex in the present focal epilepsy mainly facilitated by drawing."

        "abstract": "Since the first appearance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) earlier this year, clinicians and researchers alike have been faced with dynamic, daily challenges of recognizing, understanding, and treating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2. Those who are moderately to severely ill with COVID-19 are likely to develop acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and require administration of supplemental oxygen. Assessing the need to initiate or titrate oxygen therapy is largely dependent on evaluating the patient\u2019s existing blood oxygenation status, either by direct arterial blood sampling or by transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation monitoring, also referred to as pulse oximetry. While the sampling of arterial blood for measurement of dissolved gases provides a direct measurement, it is technically challenging to obtain, is painful to the patient, and can be time and resource intensive. Pulse oximetry allows for non-invasive, real-time, continuous monitoring of the percent of hemoglobin molecules that are saturated with oxygen, and usually closely predicts the arterial oxygen content. As such, it was particularly concerning when patients with severe COVID-19 requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation within one of our intensive care units were observed to have significant discordance between their predicted arterial oxygen content via pulse oximetry and their actual measured oxygen content. We offer these preliminary observations along with our speculative causes as a timely, urgent clinical need. In the setting of a COVID-19 intensive care unit, entering a patient room to obtain a fresh arterial blood gas sample not only takes exponentially longer to do given the time required for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE), it involves the consumption of already sparce PPE, and it increases the risk of viral exposure to the nurse, physician, or respiratory therapist entering the room to obtain the sample. As such, technology similar to pulse oximetry which can be applied to a patients finger, and then continuously monitored from outside the room is essential in preventing a particularly dangerous situation of unrealized hypoxia in this critically-ill patient population. Additionally, it would appear that conventional two-wavelength pulse oximetry may not accurately predict the arterial oxygen content of blood in these patients. This discordance of oxygenation measurements poses a critical concern in the evaluation and management of the acute hypoxemic respiratory failure seen in patients with COVID-19."

However, its adverse effects on heart have not been sufficiently investigated. This study evaluated the cardiac influence and molecular events occurring within the myocardium in rats treated with a dose of acetaminophen large enough to induce conventional liver damage. Male rats were orally administered a single dose of acetaminophen at 1,000 mg/kg-body weight, and subsequently examined for conventional toxicological parameters and for gene expression alterations to both the heart and liver 24 hours after administration. Following treatment, serum biochemical parameters including aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were elevated. Histopathological alterations of necrosis were observed in the liver, but not in the heart. However, alterations in gene expression were observed in both the liver and heart 24 hours after dosing. Transcriptional profiling revealed that acetaminophen changed the expression of genes implicated in oxidative stress, inflammatory processes, and apoptosis in the heart as well as in the liver. The numbers of up-regulated and down-regulated genes in the heart were 271 and 81, respectively, based on a two-fold criterion. The induced expression of genes implicated in oxidative stress and inflammatory processes in the myocardium reflects molecular levels of injury caused by acetaminophen (APAP), which could not be identified by conventional histopathology."

We assessed the psychological impact of the lockdown on Belgian residents in urology and their resounding on the quality of the training. A self-administered anonymous questionnaire assessing the risk of burnout in a pandemic situation and its impact on the quality of the training was e-mailed to the members of the European Society of Residents in Urology of Belgium (ESRU-B). We used the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory score which assesses the different dimensions of burnout (personal (CBIP), professional (CBIPro), relational (CBIR)). Several questions evaluating impact on residents\u2019 health and apprehension of the future were included. The survey lasted for 5\u00a0days. Comparison of parameters before and during the coronavirus crisis was made using paired samples t -test or Chi 2 test were. Fifty percent (62/126) of the ESRU-B members replied to the questionnaire. If 93% of the responders reported a negative impact on the quality of their practical training (CI95\u00a0=\u00a0[0.07\u20131.10]; P =\u00a00.83), 56% and 61.7% reported a positive impact of the crisis on their life and on their theoretical training respectively. Burnout risk scores were significantly reduced ( P <\u00a00.001) for each dimension 7.26 to 3.40 (CBIP), 9.02 to 4.35 (CBIPro) and 4.42 to 3.03 (CBIR) respectively. Despite a negative impact on the daily work quality, the decrease in activity induced by the lockdown did not have a negative psychological impact on Belgian residents in urology but stress the opportunity to review the current training system to be better balanced between practice and theoretical formation."

To understand this at the local level, we assessed the effect of four weather components (humidity, rainfall, temperature and sunshine) on the number of dengue cases in nine provinces of Vietnam. Monthly data from 1999 to 2009 were analysed by time-series regression using negative binomial models. A test for heterogeneity was applied to assess the weather-dengue association in the provinces. Those associations were significantly heterogeneous (for temperature, humidity, and sunshine: P < 0.001 heterogeneity test; for rainfall: P = 0.018 heterogeneity test). This confirms that weather components strongly affect dengue transmission at a lag time of 0 to 3 months, with considerable variation in their influence among different areas in Vietnam. This finding may promote the strategic prevention of dengue disease by suggesting specific plans at the local level, rather than a nationally unified approach."

To understand the roles of ethylene response factors (ERFs) in defence responses, the first member of the ERF family in T. intermedium , TiERF1, was characterized and functionally analysed in this study. The TiERF1 gene encodes a putative protein of 292 amino acids, belonging to the B3 subgroup of the ERF transcription factor family. Biochemical assays demonstrated that the TiERF1 protein is capable of binding to the GCC box, a cis -element present in the promoters of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, and possessing transactivation activity, as well as localizing to the nucleus. The transcript of TiERF1 in T. intermedium is rapidly induced by infection with Rhizoctonia cerealis , Fusarium graminearum , or Blumeria graminis , and ethylene, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid treatments. More importantly, the ectopic expression of TiERF1 in tobacco activated the transcript of the PR genes of tobacco with a GCC box cis -element, and ACO and ACS genes key to ethylene synthesis, and in turn improved the resistance level to Alternaria alternata and tobacco mosaic virus, as well as causing some phenotypic changes associated with ethylene response in the transgenic tobacco plants. Taken together, TiERF1 protein as an ERF transcription activator positively regulates defence responses via the activation of some defence-related genes."

        "abstract": "Diarrhea poses a substantial burden for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), negatively impacting quality-of-life (QoL) and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. During the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) era, as incidence of opportunistic infection as a cause of diarrhea decreased, incidence of noninfectious diarrhea (including diarrhea as an adverse event [AE] of cART and HIV enteropathy) increased proportionately. A literature search was conducted for information on prevalence, etiology, and treatment options for noninfectious diarrhea in patients with HIV. For marketed antiretroviral therapies, up to 28% of patients live with >4 loose or watery stools per day. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not require pharmaceutical manufacturers to include, within approved prescribing information, prevalence rates for all grades of diarrhea. Traditionally, noninfectious diarrhea management focused on avoiding use of diarrhea-associated cART; symptom management (nonpharmacologic and/or pharmacologic); and, as a last resort, changing cART. Examining the evidence upon which this approach is based reveals that most strategies rely upon anecdotal information and case reports. This review summarizes the literature and updates clinicians on the most recent options for management of noninfectious diarrhea in patients with HIV. Diarrhea in patients with HIV is a significant unmet clinical need that contributes to worsening QoL and complicates medical management. Approaching management using a stepwise method of nonpharmacologic (diet), nonprescription (over-the-counter) and, finally, prescription agent changes (modification of cART or addition of an evidence-based antidiarrheal) appears reasonable, despite a lack of clear scientific evidence to support the initial two steps of this approach. If diet modifications, including psyllium and fiber introduction, fail to resolve noninfectious diarrhea in patients with HIV, loperamide followed by crofelemer should be considered. Clinicians are encouraged to review the most recent literature, not rely upon prescribing information. Continued vigilance by HIV providers to the presence of gastrointestinal AEs, even in patients taking the most recently approved antiretroviral agents, is warranted. Additional research is justified in identifying the etiology and management of HIV-associated diarrhea in patients on successful cART regimens.

This present study incorporated multiple structural and functional connectivity metrics into a graph theoretical analysis framework and investigated alterations in brain network topology in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. By using this multiparametric analysis, we expected different connectivity metrics may reflect additional or complementary information regarding the topological changes in brain networks in MCI or AD. In our study, a total of 73 subjects participated in this study and underwent the magnetic resonance imaging scans. For the structural network, we compared commonly used connectivity metrics, including fractional anisotropy and normalized streamline count, with multiple diffusivity-based metrics. We compared Pearson correlation and covariance by investigating their sensitivities to functional network topology. Significant disruption of structural network topology in MCI and AD was found predominantly in regions within the limbic system, prefrontal and occipital regions, in addition to widespread alterations of local efficiency. At a global scale, our results showed that the disruption of the structural network was consistent across different edge definitions and global network metrics from the MCI to AD stages. Significant changes in connectivity and tract-specific diffusivity were also found in several limbic connections. Our findings suggest that tract-specific metrics (e.g., fractional anisotropy and diffusivity) provide more sensitive and interpretable measurements than does metrics based on streamline count. Besides, the use of inversed radial diffusivity provided additional information for understanding alterations in network topology caused by AD progression and its possible origins. Use of this proposed multiparametric network analysis framework may facilitate early MCI diagnosis and AD prevention. \u2022 Alzheimer's disease alters structural network mainly in limbic and superior frontal regions. \u2022 Altered global network topology may occur in earlier stage during mild cognitive impairment. \u2022 The capability of proposed multiparametric network analysis has been demonstrated. \u2022 The potential of inversed radial diffusivity on network analysis has been shown.

Single eyes from 305 patients with glaucoma and 55 heathy participants were included in this multicenter, cross-sectional study. The ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness was measured using spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Visual field measurements were performed using the Humphrey 10-2 test. All A-scan pixels (128 \u00d7 512 pixels) were allocated to the closest 10-2 location with both displacement models using degree and millimeter scales. Structure-function relationships were investigated between GCIPL thickness and corresponding visual sensitivity in nonlong (160 eyes) and long (200 eyes) axial length (AL) groups. In both the nonlong and long AL groups, compared with the no-displacement model, both the Drasdo and the Sj\u00f6strand models showed that the structure-function relationship around the fovea improved ( P < 0.05). The magnitude of improvement in the area was either comparable between the model or was larger for the Drasdo model than the Sj\u00f6strand model ( P < 0.05). Meanwhile, structure-function relationships outside the innermost retinal region that were based on the Drasdo and Sj\u00f6strand models were comparable to or were even worse than (in the case of the Drasdo model) those obtained using the no-displacement model. Structure-function relationships evaluated based on both the Drasdo and Sj\u00f6strand models significantly improved around the fovea, particularly when using the Drasdo model.

The median survival time is 14 months for patients who can be treated surgically, versus 3.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5 months for patients with metastasis who could not undergo surgery. Radical surgical resection, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy are the main treatments, but prognosis remains poor because of rapid progression and high recurrence and metastasis rates. At present, there is no unified standard treatment, and selecting the correct treatment plan and improving patient survival and quality of life remain challenging. We have reported the case of a 45-year-old woman with a primary heart tumor that infiltrated the right atrial wall and pericardium. Angiosarcoma was verified histologically. After palliative resection of the primary tumor followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy and targeted therapy, the patient exhibited overall survival of 23 months, highlighting the potential utility of this treatment strategy."

        "title": "Mouse model systems of autism spectrum disorder: Replicability and informatics signature",
        "abstract": "Phenotyping mouse model systems of human disease has proven to be a difficult task, with frequent poor inter\u2010 and intra\u2010laboratory replicability, particularly in behavioral domains such as social and cognitive function. However, establishing robust animal model systems with strong construct validity is of fundamental importance as they are central tools for understanding disease pathophysiology and developing therapeutics. To complete our studies of mouse model systems relevant to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we present a replication of the main findings from our two published studies of five genetic mouse model systems of ASD. To assess the intra\u2010laboratory robustness of previous results, we chose the two model systems that showed the greatest phenotypic differences, the Shank3/F and Cntnap2 , and repeated assessments of general health, activity and social behavior. We additionally explored all five model systems in the same framework, comparing all results obtained in this three\u2010yearlong effort using informatics techniques to assess commonalities and differences. Our results showed high intra\u2010laboratory replicability of results, even for those with effect sizes that were not particularly large, suggesting that discrepancies in the literature may be dependent on subtle but pivotal differences in testing conditions, housing enrichment, or background strains and less so on the variability of the behavioral phenotypes. The overall informatics analysis suggests that in our behavioral assays we can separate the set of tested mouse model system into two main classes that in some aspects lie on opposite ends of the behavioral spectrum, supporting the view that autism is not a unitary concept. Despite many of our findings not replicating with results published in the literature, we found overall excellent replication of most of the results from our previous publications, using the same protocols and animal models and often after consultation with the originating laboratories. In the present collection of studies, wild type controls' data were robust and consistent, although there were exceptions. The direction of the genotype effects, and often the effect size, was also very comparable. We argue that the problem in the lack of replicability of results resides more in the differences between labs, protocols, husbandry, data handling and statistical analysis, that lead to different outcomes, than in the variability of the animal models themselves.

Its estimation and control have been an important issue in solid-state physics. The band gap can be controlled externally by various parameters, such as pressure, atomic compositions, and external field. Sometimes, the gap even collapses by tuning some parameter. In the field of topological insulators, this closing of the gap at a time-reversal invariant momentum indicates a band inversion, that is, it leads to a topological phase transition from a normal insulator to a topological insulator. We show, through an exhaustive study on possible space groups, that the gap closing in inversion-asymmetric crystals is universal, in the sense that the gap closing always leads either to a Weyl semimetal or to a nodal-line semimetal. We consider three-dimensional spinful systems with time-reversal symmetry. The space group of the system and the wave vector at the gap closing uniquely determine which possibility occurs and where the gap-closing points or lines lie in the wave vector space after the closing of the gap. In particular, we show that an insulator-to-insulator transition never happens, which is in sharp contrast to inversion-symmetric systems."

The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database including all adult patients undergoing posterior lumbar interbody fusion or transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion between 2005 and 2012. Outcomes measured included mortality, postoperative complications, length of stay, reoperations, and readmissions. The previously described mFI was calculated, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to analyze risk factors associated with morbidity, mortality, and adverse postoperative events. This study was qualified as exempt by the Mount Sinai Hospital Institutional Review Board. A total of 6094 patients met inclusion criteria. The mean mFI was 0.087(0-0.545). Increasing mFI score was associated with increased complications, reoperations, prolonged length of stay (LOS), and morbidity ( P < .05). As the mFI score increased from 0.27 (3/11 variables present) to \u22650.36 (4/11), the rate of any complication increased from 26.8% to 35% ( P < .0001), sepsis 2.4% to 5.2% ( P < .0001), wound complications 4.4% to 6.5% ( P < .0001), unplanned readmissions 4.7% to 20% ( P = .02), and urinary tract infection 4.1% to 10.4% ( P < .0001). An mFI of \u22650.36 was an independent predictor of any complication (odds ratio [OR]= 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-3.7), sepsis (OR = 6.3, 95%, CI = 1.8-21), wound complications (OR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.1-8.2), prolonged LOS (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.4-3.7), and readmission (OR = 4.3, 95% CI = 1.5-12.7). Patients with higher mFI scores (\u2265 4/11 variables) are at a significantly higher risk of major complications, readmissions, and prolonged LOS following lumbar fusion."

Bacterial endophytes are ubiquitous in the phytosystem and beneficial for the plant growth and productivity. The present study aimed to obtain endophytic bacterial strains that can be developed as effective plant growth promoters. For this purpose twelve strains of bacterial endophytes were isolated from different plant sources and their putative plant growth promoting attributes were analyzed by morphological and biochemical studies. Subsequently these isolates were inoculated in the Solanum lycopersicum (Tomato) and the factors like germination percentage, seedling length, biomass production, and leaf variables were analyzed. However, the vigour index was considered as the prime parameter for determining plant growth. In essence, RR2 and RR4 strains were observed as effective growth promoter, hence in future they can be utilized as effective biofertilizers.

The results of the migration and Matrigel invasion assays indicated that the inhibitor of JNK SP600125 could inhibit the effect of 4-HPR on EJ cells. The expression of Wnt5a and MMP-2, and the phosphorylation of JNK, were analyzed by western blotting. The data revealed that 4-HPR inhibited the migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells through stimulating Wnt5a activation, causing the downregulation of MMP-2 expression and enhancing the phosphorylation of JNK in these cells. However, JNK signaling did not appear to have a direct effect on the expression of MMP-2. The present study demonstrated that 4-HPR may be a potent anti-invasive and anti-metastatic agent that functions via the Wnt5a/JNK and Wnt5a/MMP-2 signaling pathways."

However, resistance to ALK-TKIs has emerged. ALK-TKIs are associated with significantly disabling and undesirable effects that adversely impact quality of life and compliance. This study reviews the pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety of ALK-TKI agents in order to summarize these effects as well as the relevant management strategies. It is worth emphasizing that the frequency and severity of an adverse effect often varies across different trials."

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered concerns about the emergence of more infectious and pathogenic viral strains. As a public health measure, efficient screening methods are needed to determine the functional effects of new sequence variants. Here we show that structural modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding to the human ACE2 receptor, the first step in host-cell entry, predicts many novel variant combinations with enhanced binding affinities. By focusing on natural variants at the Spike-hACE2 interface and assessing over 700 mutant complexes, our analysis reveals that high-affinity Spike mutations (including N440K, S443A, G476S, E484R, G502P) tend to cluster near known human ACE2 recognition sites (K31 and K353). These Spike regions are structurally flexible, allowing certain mutations to optimize interface interaction energies. Although most human ACE2 variants tend to weaken binding affinity, they can interact with Spike mutations to generate high-affinity double mutant complexes, suggesting variation in individual susceptibility to infection. Applying structural analysis to highly transmissible variants, we find that circulating point mutations S477N, E484K and N501Y form high-affinity complexes (~40% more than wild-type). By combining predicted affinities and available antibody escape data, we show that fast-spreading viral variants exploit combinatorial mutations possessing both enhanced affinity and antibody resistance, including S477N/E484K, E484K/N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y. Thus, three-dimensional modeling of the Spike/hACE2 complex predicts changes in structure and binding affinity that correlate with transmissibility and therefore can help inform future intervention strategies."

In this study, quantitative body composition measurements using computed tomography (CT) were investigated in relation to survival, post\u2010operative complications, and surgical site infections in surgical patients with cancer of the head of the pancreas. A prospective cohort of 199 patients with cancer of the head of the pancreas was analysed by CT imaging at the L3 level to determine (i) muscle radiation attenuation (average Hounsfield units of total L3 skeletal muscle); (ii) visceral adipose tissue area; (iii) subcutaneous adipose tissue area; (iv) intermuscular adipose tissue area; and (v) skeletal muscle area. Sex\u2010specific cut\u2010offs were determined at the lower tertile for muscle radiation attenuation and skeletal muscle area and the higher tertile for adipose tissues. These variables of body composition were related to overall survival, severe post\u2010operative complications (Dindo\u2013Clavien\u2009\u2265\u20093), and surgical site infections (wounds inspected daily by an independent trial nurse) using Cox\u2010regression analysis and multivariable logistic regression analysis, respectively. Low muscle radiation attenuation was associated with shorter survival in comparison with moderate and high muscle radiation attenuation [median survival 10.8 (95% CI: 8.8\u201312.8) vs. 17.4 (95% CI: 14.7\u201320.1), and 18.5 (95% CI: 9.2\u201327.8) months, respectively; P <\u20090.008]. Patient subgroups with high muscle radiation attenuation combined with either low visceral adipose tissue or age <70\u2009years had longer survival than other subgroups ( P =\u20090.011 and P =\u20090.001, respectively). Muscle radiation attenuation was inversely correlated with intermuscular adipose tissue ( r  p =\u2009\u22120.697, P <\u20090.001). High visceral adipose tissue was associated with an increased surgical site infection rate, OR: 2.4 (95% CI: 1.1\u20135.3; P =\u20090.027). Low muscle radiation attenuation was associated with reduced survival, and high visceral adiposity was associated with an increase in surgical site infections. The strong correlation between muscle radiation attenuation and intermuscular adipose tissue suggests the presence of ectopic fat in muscle, warranting further investigation.

Nonetheless, whether the expression profile of miR-628 is altered in gastric cancer remains unclear and whether its aberrant expression plays a crucial part in the aggressiveness of gastric cancer is yet to be determined. Therefore, in this study, we systematically investigated the involvement of miR-628 in gastric cancer progression. MiR-628 expression in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines were determined via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). A CCK-8 assay, flow-cytometric analysis, Transwell assays, and a xenograft model experiment were performed to evaluate the influence of miR-628 overexpression on gastric cancer cells. Notably, the mechanisms underlying the tumor-suppressive activity of miR-628 in gastric cancer cells were explored by bioinformatics analysis, a luciferase reporter assay, RT-qPCR, and Western blotting. MiR-628 expression was low in gastric cancer tissue samples and cell lines. The low expression of miR-628 was closely associated with the lymph node metastasis, invasive depth and TNM stage among patients with gastric cancer. Further clinical analysis indicated that patients with gastric cancer underexpressing miR-628 had a worse prognosis than did the patients with high miR-628 expression in the tumor. Overexpressed miR-628 restrained proliferation, migration, and invasion; induced apoptosis; and impaired tumor growth of gastric cancer cells. In addition, neuropilin 1 (NRP1) mRNA was validated as the direct target of miR-628 in gastric cancer. Long noncoding RNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 16 (SNHG16) was demonstrated to sponge miR-628 in gastric cancer. Moreover, miR-628 knockdown abrogated the influence of SNHG16 silencing on gastric cancer cells. Our findings elucidate how the SNHG16\u2013miR-628\u2013NRP1 pathway serves as a regulatory network playing crucial roles in gastric cancer progression, suggesting that this pathway may be a novel target of anticancer therapy."

In the current study, we examined the role of orexin-1/hypocretin-1 receptors in operant self-administration of ethanol and sucrose and in yohimbine-induced reinstatement of ethanol and sucrose seeking. Rats were trained to self-administer either 10% ethanol or 5% sucrose (30\u00a0min/day). The orexin-1 receptor antagonist SB334867 (0, 5, 10, 15, 20\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 30\u00a0min before the operant self-administration sessions. After these experiments, the operant self-administration behaviors were extinguished in both the ethanol and sucrose-trained rats. Upon reaching extinction criteria, SB334867 (0, 5, 10\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 30\u00a0min before yohimbine (0 or 2\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.). In a separate experiment, the effect of SB334867 (0, 15, or 20\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) on general locomotor activity was determined using the open-field test. The orexin-1 receptor antagonist, SB334867 (10, 15 and 20\u00a0mg/kg) decreased operant self-administration of 10% ethanol but not 5% sucrose self-administration. Furthermore, SB334867 (5 and 10\u00a0mg/kg) significantly decreased yohimbine-induced reinstatement of both ethanol and sucrose seeking. SB334867 did not significantly affect locomotor activity measured using the open-field test. The results suggest that inhibition of OX-1/Hcrt-1 receptors modulates operant ethanol self-administration and also plays a significant role in yohimbine-induced reinstatement of both ethanol and sucrose seeking in rats."

DV was significantly related to T21, T18, and T13 (LOR\u200a=\u200a3.44, 3.89 and 3.46; P value\u200a<2.1E-13). Significant between-study variance was observed for T21 ( P value\u200a<1.71E-14), but not for T18 ( P value\u200a>.05) and T13 ( P value\u200a>.87). MLR results suggested that significant influential factors could include population region ( P value\u200a<.0021), but not sample size, data age, and maternal age ( P value\u200a>.078). Integrating DV could help in the detection of trisomy. However, accuracy and validity may vary depending on the population regions, which need further study."

Knowledge of their oral hygiene awareness, attitude and behaviour shall help in improving their oral health and also in planning oral health strategies specific to this group. To explore the oral hygiene-related knowledge, attitude and practices of transgenders residing in the Bhubaneswar during COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was conducted among the transgenders residing in Bhubaneswar using a self-structured questionnaire containing questions on knowledge, attitude and practices related to oral hygiene. Mann\u2013Whitney U test was applied to find any significant differences between different variables in groups. A total of 205 transgenders participated in the study. Around 43.9% of the transgenders in rural areas felt they had bad breath and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Majority of the participants in the rural areas did not know how to describe the health of their teeth and gums while 43% of the participants in the urban areas felt their oral health was good. There was statistically significant difference between the two groups in the type of material used for cleaning teeth [p = 0.020]. There was statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of brushing their teeth everyday [p = 0.005, duration of brushing [p = 0.052], tools used for cleaning teeth [p = 0.023] and method employed to control mouth odour. The information presented in this study adds onto our understanding of the oral hygiene related behaviour among the transgenders."

The current study aimed to observe the incidence of thalidomide-induced peripheral neuropathy among ankylosing spondylitis patients for 1 year after treatment. In this study, 207 ankylosing spondylitis cases received thalidomide treatment, while 116 ankylosing spondylitis cases received other treatments. Results showed that the incidence of thalidomide-induced peripheral neuropathy in the thalidomide group was higher than that in the non-thalidomide group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of neuropathy between the < 6 months medication and \u2265 6 months medication groups. There were no differences in the mean age, gender, or daily dose between the two groups. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy among patients receiving 25, 50, 75, or 100 mg thalidomide per day was 4.6%, 8.5%, 17.1%, 21.7%, respectively. The incidence was significantly different between the groups receiving 25 mg and 100 mg thalidomide. In conclusion, thalidomide can induce peripheral neuropathy within 1 year after treatment of ankylosing spondylitis; however, age and gender have no obvious impact on the incidence of peripheral neuropathy. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy is associated with increasing daily doses of thalidomide."

It is associated with a range of disorders, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance (IR), compensatory hyperinsulinemia, gestational, and type 2 diabetes, and increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity. There are different treatments available for PCOS. The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the effects of metformin, flutamide plus oral contraceptives (OCs), and simvastatin on the metabolic consequences of PCOS. This study was a single-blind clinical trial. The subjects were selected from a group of patient with PCOS and metabolic syndrome, who were referred to the midwifery clinic of Al-Zahra Hospital and Beheshti Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. A total of 111 subjects were randomly assigned to three groups: metformin, flutamide plus OCs, and simvastatin groups. The measurements were performed at baseline and after 6 months of therapy. Paired t -test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and chi-square test were applied in this study. A total of 102 subjects were analyzed in this study, 34 subjects were allotted in each group. The prevalence of IR was statistically different between three groups ( P -value = 0.001). After a 6-month course, metformin showed larger reduction in fasting blood sugar (FBS) level ( P -value < 0.001). However, except for metformin, two other treatments reduced C-reactive protein (CRP) level significantly (both P -values < 0.001). The level of triglycerides (TGs) decreased considerably in all groups (all P -values < 0.001). Both metformin and simvastatin decreased BMI significantly (both P -values < 0.001). None of the treatments changed high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level (all P -values > 0.05). Metformin performed better in FBS reduction. Simvastatin had better performance in terms of reducing TG level and waist circumference."

        "abstract": "In China, Bemisia tabaci Q (commonly known as biotype Q) has rapidly displaced B (commonly known as biotype B) in the past 6 years. The mechanisms underlying such phenomenon have been studied extensively in recent years; however, we have not come to a definitive conclusion yet. In the present study, the differences in host suitability between B and Q whitefly adults to five host plants (cabbage, cotton, cucumber, poinsettia, and tomato) were evaluated based on their respective feeding behaviors using a direct-current electrical penetration graph (DC-EPG) system. Pair-wise comparisons of B. tabaci B and Q feeding on each of the five host plants clearly indicate that Q feeds better than B on tomato, cotton and poinsettia, while B feeds better than Q on cabbage and cucumber. The EPG parameters related to both phloem and non-phloem phases confirm that cabbage and cucumber are best suited to B, while tomato, cotton, and poinsettia are best suited to Q. Our present results support the contention that host suitability and adult feeding behavior contribute to the competitive displacement of biotype B by biotype Q. The discrepancy between field (previous studies) and laboratory results (this study), however, suggests that 1) whitefly displacement is apparently contributed by multiple factors; and 2) factor(s) other than the host plant suitability may play a vital role in dictating the whitefly biotypes in the field."

There is little information about Chinese children and adolescents with CNS-GCTs. Therefore, in this study we retrospectively analyzed the clinical features and treatment outcome of Chinese children and adolescents with primary CNS-GCTs. Between January 2002 and December 2012, 57 untreated patients from a single institution were enrolled. They were diagnosed with CNS-GCTs after pathologic or clinical assessment. Of the 57 patients, 41 were males and 16 were females, with a median age of 12.8 years (range, 2.7 to 18.0 years) at diagnosis; 43 (75.4%) had non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCTs) and 14 (24.6%) had germinomas; 44 (77.2%) had localized disease and 13 (22.8%) had extensive lesions. Fifty-three patients completed the prescribed treatment, of which 18 underwent monotherapy of surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy, and 35 underwent multimodality therapies that included radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy or surgery combined with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. PEB (cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin) protocol was the major chemotherapy regimen. The median follow-up time was 32.3 months (range, 1.2 to 139 months). Fourteen patients died of relapse or disease progression. The 3-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival rates for all patients were 72.2% and 73.8%, respectively. The 3-year EFS was 92.9% for germinomas and 64.8% for NGGCTs ( P = 0.064). The 3-year EFS rates for patients with NGGCTs who underwent monotherapy and multimodality therapies were 50.6% and 73.5%, respectively ( P = 0.042). Our results indicate that multimodality therapies including chemotherapy plus radiotherapy were better treatment option for children and adolescents with CNS-GCTs."

The present study was prospective, randomized, double-blind conducted to evaluate the efficacy of dexmdetomidine and fentanyl in attenuation of pressor responses to laryngoscopy, intubation, and PNP in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). A total of 60 patients of 18\u201365 years, American Society of Anaesthesiologists Class I/II of either sex for elective LC, were included. The patients were divided into two groups of 30 patients each. Group I received dexmedetomidine and Group II Fentanyl loading 1 \u03bcg/kg over 15 min followed by maintenance 0.2 \u03bcg/kg/h throughout the PNP. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) were recorded preoperatively, 15 min after infusion of study drug, 1 min after induction, 1 min after intubation, throughout the PNP, end of surgery, and until 60 min in postoperative period. Sedation score, visual analog scale score along with modified Alderete score applied in postanesthesia care unit. Control of HR and MAP in Group I was better than in Group II during laryngoscopy, intubation and PNP. There was also smooth extubation, less sedation and better control of pain in Group I than in Group II. The present study demonstrates the benefits of dexmedetomidine over fentanyl in hemodynamic stability and analgesic quality in LC. Thus, it is establishing its utility over for attenuation of pressor response."

Mechanistic models that capture the dynamics of such \u201cdependent happenings\u201d are a fundamental tool of infectious disease epidemiology. Recent methodological advances combined with access to new data sources and computational power have resulted in an explosion in the use of dynamic models in the analysis of emerging and established infectious diseases. Increasing use of models to inform practical public health decision making has challenged the field to develop new methods to exploit available data and appropriately characterize the uncertainty in the results. Here, we discuss recent advances and areas of active research in the mechanistic and dynamic modeling of infectious disease. We highlight how a growing emphasis on data and inference, novel forecasting methods, and increasing access to \u201cbig data\u201d are changing the field of infectious disease dynamics. We showcase the application of these methods in phylodynamic research, which combines mechanistic models with rich sources of molecular data to tie genetic data to population-level disease dynamics. As dynamics and mechanistic modeling methods mature and are increasingly tied to principled statistical approaches, the historic separation between the infectious disease dynamics and \u201ctraditional\u201d epidemiologic methods is beginning to erode; this presents new opportunities for cross pollination between fields and novel applications."

Emerging evidence has demonstrated the critical roles of SIRT1 and microRNAs (miRNAs) in the progression of MDD. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully understood. In the present study, the expression level of miR-138 and SIRT1 were analyzed by RT-PCR or Western blotting in a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model. The depressive-like behaviors were analyzed by forced swimming test (FST) and sucrose preference test (SPT) in mice injected with miR-138 and SIRT1 overexpression lentivirus. The luciferase reporter assay was used to assess the direct regulation of miR-138 on SIRT1 expression. The upregulation of miR-138 was found in the hippocampus of the CUMS mice and correlated with decreased SIRT1 expression. C57BL/6J mice treated with SIRT1- and miR-138-expressing (miR-138) lentivirus showed increased depressive-like behaviors. In contrast, SIRT1 or si-miR-138 lentivirus treated C57BL/6J mice showed decreased depressive-like behaviors. Moreover, the Sirt1/PGC-1\u03b1/FNDC5/BDNF pathway was downregulated following miR-138 overexpression and increased upon miR-138 knockdown in hippocampus in CUMS mice and cultured primary neuronal cells. Mechanistically, luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that SIRT1 gene was a downstream transcriptional target of miR-138. Our data demonstrated the regulation role of miR-138 on SIRT1 gene expression, miR-138 increased depressive-like behaviors by regulating SIRT1 expression in hippocampus."

During infection, adherence of E. histolytica through Gal/GalNAc lectin on the surface of the amoeba can induce caspase-3-dependent or -independent host cell death. Phosphorylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase C (PKC) in E. histolytica play an important function in the adhesion, killing, or phagocytosis of target cells. In this study, we examined the role of amoebic PI3K and PKC in amoeba-induced apoptotic cell death in Jurkat T cells. When Jurkat T cells were incubated with E. histolytica trophozoites, phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization and DNA fragmentation in Jurkat cells were markedly increased compared to those of cells incubated with medium alone. However, when amoebae were pretreated with a PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin before being incubated with E. histolytica , E. histolytica -induced PS externalization and DNA fragmentation in Jurkat cells were significantly reduced compared to results for amoebae pretreated with DMSO. In addition, pretreatment of amoebae with a PKC inhibitor, staurosporine strongly inhibited Jurkat T cell death. However, E. histolytica -induced cleavage of caspase-3, -6, and -7 were not inhibited by pretreatment of amoebae with wortmannin or staurosporin. In addition, we found that amoebic PI3K and PKC have an important role on amoeba adhesion to host compartment. These results suggest that amebic PI3K and PKC activation may play an important role in caspase-independent cell death in Entamoeba -induced apoptosis."

Participants from the population\u2010based CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study year 25 exam (2010\u20132011, aged 43\u201355 years, 61% women, 48% black) with computed tomography measured liver fat and comprehensive echocardiography were included. Echocardiography was repeated at year 30 follow\u2010up (aged 47\u201362 years, N=1827). NAFLD was defined as liver attenuation \u226440 HU after exclusions. LV geometry was classified into normal and abnormal by integrating relative wall thickness and LV mass index. Diastolic function was defined using Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging. Systolic function was assessed with myocardial strain measured by speckle tracking. NAFLD prevalence was 8.7% (n=159). NAFLD participants had higher LV mass, relative wall thickness, incident LV hypertrophy and abnormal LV geometry versus non\u2010NAFLD ( P <0.02). NAFLD participants had impaired LV relaxation (E/A ratio 1.1 versus 1.2), higher LV filling pressures (E/e\u2032 ratio 7.9 versus 7.2), worse longitudinal strain (\u221213.9% versus \u221215.3%), and lower LV ejection fraction (58.9% versus 60.2%, P <0.01). In multivariable analyses adjusted for heart failure risk factors, NAFLD was independently associated with incident LV hypertrophy (odds ratio: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1\u20133.4), abnormal LV geometry (odds ratio: 1.9, 1.1\u20133.3) and greater change in strain (odds ratio: 2.2, 1.1\u20134.7). Adjustment for body mass index attenuated associations to non\u2010significance. NAFLD is associated with subclinical changes over time in LV structure/function and obesity explains much of the association. Presence of obesity in mid\u2010life may identify an important at\u2010risk population in whom to focus preventive heart failure strategies."

Brain and nerve damage are often associated with low residual level of pesticides. In vitro and in vivo studies have also shown that pesticides cause free radical-mediated tissue damage in brain. Propolis has antioxidant properties. The main chemical classes found in propolis are flavonoids and phenolics. Bioflavonoids are antioxidant molecules that play important roles in scavenging free radicals, which are produced in neurodegenerative diseases and aging. To determine the protective role of propolis, rainbow trouts were treated with cypermethrin, followed by biochemical analyses of brain tissue. Fish were divided into four groups: control, propolis-treated, cypermethrin-treated, and cypermethrin + propolis-treated. In fish brains, catalase (CAT) activity decreased (P \u2264 0.001) and malondialdehyde (MDA) level increased (P \u2264 0.001) in cypermethrin-treated group compared to control group. In cypermethrin + propolis-treated group CAT activity increased (P \u2264 0.001) and MDA level decreased (P \u2264 0.001) compared to cypermethrin group. The results demonstrated that the negative effects, observed as a result of cypermethrin treatment, could be reversed by adding supplementary propolis. Propolis may improve some biochemical markers associated with oxidative stress in fish brain, after exposure to cypermethrin."

        "abstract": "The mechanisms that coordinate the final mitotic divisions of terminally differentiated bone marrow erythroid cells with components of their structural and functional maturation program remain largely undefined. We previously identified phenotypes resembling those found in early-stage myelodysplastic syndromes, including ineffective erythropoiesis, morphologic dysplasia, and hyper-cellular bone marrow, in a knock-in mouse model in which cyclin E mutations were introduced at its two Cdc4 phosphodegrons (CPDs) to ablate Fbw7-dependent ubiquitination and degradation. Here we have examined the physiologic consequences of cyclin E dysregulation in bone marrow erythroid cells during terminal maturation in vivo. We found cyclin E protein levels in bone marrow erythroid cells are dynamically regulated in a CPD-dependent manner and that disruption of Fbw7-dependent cyclin E regulation impairs terminal erythroid cell maturation at a discrete stage prior to enucleation. At this stage of erythroid cell maturation, CPD phosphorylation of cyclin E regulates both cell cycle arrest and survival. We also found normal regulation of cyclin E restrains mitochondrial reactive oxygen species accumulation and expression of genes that promote mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism during terminal erythroid maturation. In the setting of dysregulated cyclin E expression, p53 is activated in bone marrow erythroid cells as part of a DNA damage response-type pathway, which mitigates ineffective erythropoiesis, in contrast to the role of p53 induction in other models of dyserythropoiesis. Finally, cyclin E dysregulation and ROS accumulation induce histone H3 lysine 9 hyper-methylation and disrupt components of the normal terminal erythroid maturation gene expression program. Thus, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway control of G1-to-S-phase progression is intrinsically linked to regulation of metabolism and gene expression in terminally differentiating bone marrow erythroid cells."

        "title": "The global burden of migraine: measuring disability in headache disorders with WHO's Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)",
        "abstract": "This overview of the published epidemiological evidence of migraine helps to identify the size of the public\u2013health problem that migraine represents. It also highlights the need for further epidemiological studies in many parts of the world to gain full understanding of the scale of clinical, economic and humanistic burdens attributable to it. This paper presents some of the work on migraine undertaken by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the Global Burden of Disease study conducted in 2000 and reported in the World Health Report 2001 . Migraine was not included in the first Global Burden of Disease 1990. The paper also discussed the measurement of disability attributable to headache disorders using WHO ICF Classification. Using disabilityadjusted life years (DALYs) as a summary measure of population health (which adds disability to mortality), WHO have shown that mental and neurological disorders collectively account for 30.8% of all years of healthy life lost to disability (YLDs) whilst migraine, one amongst these, alone accounts for 1.4% and is in the top 20 causes of disability worldwide. This information is combined with the increasingly widely accepted belief that disability and functioning are relevant parameters for monitoring the health of nations and that there is an increasing need to measure them. WHO's Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) provides a model of human functioning and disability, as well as a classification system, that allows us to highlight and measure all dimensions of disability. ICF applied to headache disorders allows comparability with other health conditions as well as evaluation of the role of the environment as a cause of disability amongst people with headache. Migraine causes a large propotion of the non\u2013fatal disease\u2013related burden worldwide.Our kowledge of headache related burden is incomplete and it is necessary to add to it epidemiological studies in many parts of the world and to combine this with measurements of disability using both DALYs and WHO \u2018s ICF Classification. The work described here has been the base for the Global Campaign against Headache disorders: \"Lifting the Burden\", launched in 2004 jointly by WHO, IHS (International Headache Society), WHA (World Headache Alliance) and EHF (European Headache Federation)."

Because of its potent inhibitory activity for treating a variety of diseases, the development of efficient approaches for accessing ticlopidine represents an important endeavour. Therefore, in this research work, we developed a promising novel five-step synthetic approach for synthesizing ticlopidine. This method provides ticlopidine in 60% overall yield from readily available starting material viz. thiophene. In this methodology, all steps afforded excellent yields and are operationally simple and environmentally acceptable. This approach also offers various attractive advantages, for example, it's applicable for large-scale synthesis, has simple work-up procedures and short reaction times, and uses inexpensive and readily available reagents. Furthermore, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine is a key precursor for the synthesis of numerous bioactive compounds such as prasugrel and clopidogrel. This protocol provides 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine in 62% overall yield via a 4-step synthetic approach.

        "abstract": "To date, information about reasons to select and kill poultry on-farm and which method veterinarians and poultry producers preferably use is scarce. Little is also known about their knowledge of the legislation regarding on-farm killing methods and of methods alternative to the one(s) they use, as well as their perception of those alternatives. In this study, Flemish poultry veterinarians (n = 13), broiler chicken producers (n = 27), and turkey producers (n = 4) were surveyed on killing methods they currently use in practice and alternative methods, on their opinion about what constitutes an appropriate method for on-farm killing of poultry, and on their reasons for killing. All poultry veterinarians and chicken producers who filled out the survey kill poultry by manual cervical dislocation ( CD ), whereas some turkey farmers also indicated killing by percussive blow to the head (n = 1) or exsanguination (n = 1). Turkey producers seem to be more inclined not to kill animals with injuries or symptoms of disease as compared to veterinarians or chicken producers, such that moribund turkeys are more likely to remain in the flock. Veterinarians considered the following properties of a killing method important: animal friendliness, applicability inside the stable, a high success rate, and time efficiency. Producers ranked the properties similarly, but for them, ease of performance and cost-efficiency were more important than applicability inside the stable. Producers scored those killing properties rather positively for manual as well as mechanical CD. Veterinarians and chicken producers considered the captive bolt method to be easy to perform, to have a high success rate, to be feasible to perform in the stable, and to be animal-friendly. Turkey producers, however, had doubts about the latter 2 properties. Gas, injection, and electrocution were inferior methods to kill poultry according to producers. In conclusion, manual CD is the most common method for killing broiler chickens and turkeys, and knowledge of, and experience with, alternative methods is very limited, both among veterinarians and producers. Informing them about legislation and training for the use of alternative killing techniques are recommended."

        "abstract": "Immortalizing primary cells with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) has been common practice to enable primary cells to be of extended use in the laboratory because they avoid replicative senescence. Studying exogenously expressed hTERT in cells also affords scientists models of early carcinogenesis and telomere behavior. Control and the premature ageing disease\u2014Hutchinson\u2010Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) primary dermal fibroblasts, with and without the classical G608G mutation have been immortalized with exogenous hTERT. However, hTERT immortalization surprisingly elicits genome reorganization not only in disease cells but also in the normal control cells, such that whole chromosome territories normally located at the nuclear periphery in proliferating fibroblasts become mislocalized in the nuclear interior. This includes chromosome 18 in the control fibroblasts and both chromosomes 18 and X in HGPS cells, which physically express an isoform of the LINC complex protein SUN1 that has previously only been theoretical. Additionally, this HGPS cell line has also become genomically unstable and has a tetraploid karyotype, which could be due to the novel SUN1 isoform. Long\u2010term treatment with the hTERT inhibitor BIBR1532 enabled the reduction of telomere length in the immortalized cells and resulted that these mislocalized internal chromosomes to be located at the nuclear periphery, as assessed in actively proliferating cells. Taken together, these findings reveal that elongated telomeres lead to dramatic chromosome mislocalization, which can be restored with a drug treatment that results in telomere reshortening and that a novel SUN1 isoform combined with elongated telomeres leads to genomic instability. Thus, care should be taken when interpreting data from genomic studies in hTERT\u2010immortalized cell lines."

While interstitial lung disease (ILD) has been regarded as a serious complication of pleurodesis, its clinicopathological characteristics have not been fully understood. This study was conducted to elucidate the incidence of ILD and the risk factors for ILD in patients who underwent pleurodesis to control MPE. The medical records of patients who underwent pleurodesis in Aichi Medical University between March 2008 and February 2013, the period before the approval of talc in Japan, were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 84 patients underwent pleurodesis, all using OK-432. ILD occurred in 13 patients (15.5%). The development of ILD after pleurodesis was significantly associated with old age (odds ratio [OR]: 4.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22-19.08) and epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) treatment (OR: 5.97, CI: 1.7-20.9). A multivariate analysis revealed that >67 years of age (p=0.01) and EGFR-TKI treatment (p=0.02) were significantly associated with the development of pleurodesis-related ILD. Among the patients who received both pleurodesis and EGFR-TKIs (n=23), 8 patients developed ILD. All of these patients were receiving EGFR-TKI therapy at the time of pleurodesis or within 30 days after pleurodesis. In contrast, no cases of ILD were observed among the patients who stopped EGFR-TKIs before pleurodesis or started EGFR-TKIs at more than 30 days after pleurodesis. ILD seemed to be a frequent complication of pleurodesis in patients using OK-432, especially elderly patients and those who underwent pleurodesis while receiving EGFR-TKI therapy or who started EGFR-TKI therapy within 30 days after pleurodesis."

        "abstract": "During the Third Reich, state\u2010sponsored violence was linked to scientific research on many levels. Prisoners were used as involuntary subjects for medical experiments, and body parts from victims were used in anatomy and neuropathology on a massive scale. In many cases, such specimens remained in scientific collections and were used until long after the war. International bioethics, for a long time, had little to say on the issue. Since the late 1980s, with a renewed interest in the Holocaust and other Nazi crimes, a consensus has increasingly taken hold that research on human tissues and body parts from the Nazi era is inadmissible, and that such specimens should be removed from scientific collections and buried. The question of what to do with scientific data obtained from these sources has not received adequate attention, however, and remains unsolved. This paper traces the history of debates about the ethical implications of using human tissue or body parts from the Nazi period for scientific purposes, primarily in the fields of anatomy and neuropathology. It also examines how this issue, from after the war until today, influenced the establishment of legal and bioethical norms on the use of human remains from morally tainted sources, with a particular emphasis on Germany and Austria. It is argued that the use of such specimens and of data derived from them is unethical not only because of potential harms to posthumous rights of the victims, but also because such use constitutes a moral harm to society at large."

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent malignancy characterized by aggressiveness and poor prognosis; however, the molecular mechanism remains to be fully identified. Based on the analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, melanoma-associated antigen A3 (MAGEA3) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC01234 were upregulated in HCC and associated with poor prognosis of HCC. We investigated the mechanism of how MAGEA3 and LINC01234 influenced HCC cellular functions and cisplatin resistance. MAGEA3 depletion inhibited proliferation, invasion, and cisplatin resistance of HepG2 cells and Huh7 cells in\u00a0vitro , reduced resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), MRP3, and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR-1) expression, and elevated ALB expression. RNA pull-down and RIP assays identified the binding of LINC01234 and MAGEA3 to microRNA-31-5p (miR-31-5p). LINC01234 could restore MAGEA3 expression by binding to miR-31-5p. Furthermore, we delivered plasmids into HepG2 cells and Huh7 cells to alter the expression of LINC01234 and miR-31-5p. When miR-31-5p was downregulated, the proliferation and invasion of HepG2 cells and Huh7 cells were enhanced and the cisplatin-induced apoptosis was inhibited, while LINC01234 knockdown could diminish the effects caused by miR-31-5p depletion. In summary, these data highlight the vital role of MAGEA3/LINC01234/miR-31-5p axis in the HCC progression and chemoresistance of HCC cells."

After treatment with adrenaline and corticosteroids, the patient became hemodynamically stable and left the hospital on the next day. She attended our hospital 1 week after the onset of anaphylaxis because of repeated postprandial epigastric pain. No abnormal lesions were found in endoscopy. Radiographic selective catheter angiography revealed chronic mesenteric ischemia caused by atherosclerosis and abundant collateral arteries between the celiac trunk, the superior mesenteric artery and the inferior mesenteric artery. Patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia usually present with a clinical syndrome characterized by painful abdominal cramps and colic occurring typically during the postprandial phase. Fear of eating resulted in malnutrition. She was prescribed proton pump inhibitor, digestants, anticholinergic agents, serine protease inhibitors, prokinetics, antiplatelet agents and transdermal nitroglycerin intermittently, but these had no beneficial effects. It was most probable that this patient with chronic atherosclerotic mesenteric ischemia was suffering from functional abdominal pain syndrome induced by anaphylaxis. Since psychiatric disorders were associated with alterations in the processing of visceral sensation, we facilitated the patient's understanding of functional abdominal pain syndrome with the psychologist. Postprandial abdominal pain gradually faded after administration of these drugs and the patient left the hospital. Developing a satisfactory patient-physician relationship was considered more effective for the management of persistent abdominal pain caused by complicated mechanisms."

In this work, the catalytic mechanism of M pro was studied using the full model of the enzyme and a computational QM/MM methodology with a 69/72-atoms QM region treated at DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS//B3LYP/6-31G(d,p):AMBER level and including the catalytic important oxyanion-hole residues. The transition state of each step was fully characterized and described together with the related reactants and products. The rate-limiting step of the catalytic process is the hydrolysis of the thioester-enzyme adduct, and the calculated barrier closely agrees with the available kinetic data. The calculated Gibbs free energy profile, together with the full atomistic detail of the structures involved in catalysis, can now serve as valuable models for the rational drug design of transition state analogs as new inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The constituents of cortical volume \u2013 cortical thickness and surface area \u2013 have separable developmental trajectories and are related to different neurobiological processes. However, little is known about the developmental trajectories of cortical thickness and surface area in ASD. In this magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study, we used an accelerated longitudinal design to investigate the cortical development in 90 individuals with ASD and 90 typically developing controls, aged 9 to 20\u00a0years. We quantified cortical measures using the FreeSurfer software package, and then used linear mixed model analyses to estimate the developmental trajectories for each cortical measure. Our primary finding was that the development of surface area follows a linear trajectory in ASD that differs from typically developing controls. In typical development, we found a decline in cortical surface area between the ages of 9 and 20 that was absent in ASD. We found this pattern in all regions where developmental trajectories for surface area differed between groups. When we applied a more stringent correction that takes the interdependency of measures into account, this effect on cortical surface area retained significance for left banks of superior temporal sulcus, postcentral area, and right supramarginal area. These areas have previously been implicated in ASD and are involved in the interpretation and processing of audiovisual social stimuli and distinction between self and others. Although some differences in cortical volume and thickness were found, none survived the more stringent correction for multiple testing. This study underscores the importance of distinguishing between cortical surface area and thickness in investigating cortical development, and suggests the development of cortical surface area is of importance to ASD. \u2022 Cortical development differs between ASD and typical development in adolescence. \u2022 These are primarily differences in the development of cortical surface area. \u2022 In most regions surface area decreases for controls, not for individuals with ASD. \u2022 After stringent multiple testing correction, this pattern held for three regions. \u2022 The development of cortical surface area is relevant to ASD during adolescence.

        "abstract": "Is electronic digital classification/staging of endometriosis by the EQUSUM application more accurate in calculating the scores/stages and is it easier to use compared to non-digital classification? We developed the first digital visual classification system in endometriosis (EQUSUM). This merges the three currently most frequently used separate endometriosis classification/scoring systems (i.e. revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine (rASRM), Enzian and Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI)) to allow uniform and adequate classification and registration, which is easy to use. The EQUSUM showed significant improvement in correctly classifying/scoring endometriosis and is more user-friendly compared to non-digital classification. Endometriosis classification is complex and until better classification systems are developed and validated, ideally all women with endometriosis undergoing surgery should have a correct rASRM score and stage, while women with deep endometriosis (DE) should have an Enzian classification and if there is a fertility wish, the EFI score should be calculated. A prospective endometriosis classification proof of concept study under experts in deep endometriosis was conducted. A comparison was made between currently used non-digital classification formats for endometriosis versus a newly developed digital classification application (EQUSUM). A hypothetical operative endometriosis case was created and summarized in both non-digital and digital form. During European endometriosis expert meetings, 45 DE experts were randomly assigned to the classic group versus the digital group to provide a proper classification of this DE case. Each expert was asked to provide the rASRM score and stage, Enzian and EFI score. Twenty classic forms and 20 digital forms were analysed. Questions about the user-friendliness (system usability scale (SUS) and subjective mental effort questionnaire (SMEQ)) of both systems were collected. The rASRM stage was scored completely correctly by 10% of the experts in the classic group compared to 75% in the EQUSUM group ( P <  0. 01). The rASRM numerical score was calculated correctly by none of the experts in the classic group compared with 70% in the EQUSUM group ( P <  0.01). The Enzian score was correct in 60% of the classic group compared to 90% in the EQUSUM group ( P =  0.03). EFI scores were calculated correctly in 25% of the classic group versus 85% in the EQUSUM group ( P <  0.01). Finally, the usability measured with the SUS was significantly better in the EQUSUM group compared to the classic group: 80.8\u2009\u00b1\u200911.4 and 61.3\u2009\u00b1\u200920.5 ( P <  0.01). Also the mental effort measured with the SMEQ was significant lower in the EQUSUM group compared to the classic group: 52.1\u2009\u00b1\u200918.7 and 71.0\u2009\u00b1\u200929.1 ( P =  0.04). Future research should further develop and confirm these initial findings by conducting similar studies with larger study groups, to limit the possible role of chance. These first results are promising, however it is important to note that this is a preliminary result of experts in DE and needs further testing in daily practice with different types (complex and easy) of endometriosis cases and less experienced gynaecologists in endometriosis surgery. This is the first time that the rASRM, Enzian and EFI are combined in one web-based application to simplify correct and automatic endometriosis classification/scoring and surgical registration through infographics. Collection of standardized data with the EQUSUM could improve endometriosis reporting and increase the uniformity of scientific output. However, this requires a broad implementation. To launch the EQUSUM application, a one-time financial support was provided by Medtronic to cover the implementation cost. No competing interests were declared. N/A."

They have certain biological, epidemiological and pathological similarities. To date, research has shown that their genes exhibit 79% of identical sequences and the receptor-binding domain structure is also very similar. There has been extensive research performed on SARS; however, the understanding of the pathophysiological impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still limited. This review drew upon the lessons learnt from SARS, in terms of epidemiology, clinical characteristics and pathogenesis, to further understand the features of COVID-19. By comparing these two diseases, it found that COVID-19 has quicker and wider transmission, obvious family agglomeration, and higher morbidity and mortality. Newborns, asymptomatic children and normal chest imaging cases emerged in COVID-19 literature. Children starting with gastrointestinal symptoms may progress to severe conditions and newborns whose mothers are infected with COVID-19 could have severe complications. The laboratory test data showed that the percentage of neutrophils and the level of LDH is higher, and the number of CD4+ and CD8+T-cells is decreased in children's COVID-19 cases. Based on these early observations, as pediatricians, this review put forward some thoughts on children's COVID-19 and gave some recommendations to contain the disease."

Cachexia presents in patients with a number of complex traits, including both cancer and COPD. The objective of the current investigation was to search for a shared genetic aetiology for change in body mass index (\u0394BMI) among cancer and COPD by using GWAS data in the Framingham Heart Study. A linear mixed effects model accounting for age, sex, and change in smoking status was used to calculate \u0394BMI in participants over 40\u2009years of age with three consecutive BMI time points ( n =\u20094162). Four GWAS of \u0394BMI using generalized estimating equations were performed among 1085 participants with a cancer diagnosis, 204 with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, 112 with lung cancer, and 237 with COPD to test for association with 418\u2009365 single\u2010nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Two SNPs reached a level of genome\u2010wide significance ( P <\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u22128 ) with \u0394BMI: (i) rs41526344 within the CNTN4 gene, among COPD cases ( \u03b2 =\u20090.13, P =\u20094.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u22128 ); and (ii) rs4751240 in the gene Dedicator of Cytokinesis 1 ( DOCK1 ) among GI cancer cases ( \u03b2 =\u20090.10, P =\u20091.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u22128 ). The DOCK1 SNP association replicated in the \u0394BMI GWAS among COPD cases ( \u03b2  meta\u2010analyis =\u20090.10, P  meta\u2010analyis =\u20099.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u221210 ). The DOCK1 gene codes for the dedicator of cytokinesis 1 protein, which has a role in myoblast fusion. In sum, one statistically significant common variant in the DOCK1 gene was associated with \u0394BMI in GI cancer and COPD cases providing support for at least partially shared aetiology of \u0394BMI in complex diseases."

It is, therefore, important to understand the signaling pathways that mediate disease progression in order to identify new molecular targets for therapeutic development. Here, we report that the blood serum levels of ephrin-A1 and the sheddase ADAM12 were significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients treated at SUNY Downstate Hospital of Brooklyn, New York. Both ephrin-A1 and ADAM12 are known to be involved in inflammation and regulate endothelial cell permeability, thus providing a gateway to lung injury. The clinical outcome correlated with the ephrin-A1 and ADAM12 serum levels during the first week of hospitalization. In contrast, the serum levels of TNF\u03b1 were elevated in only a small subset of the patients, and these same patients also had highly elevated levels of the sheddase ADAM17. These data indicate that ephrin-A1-mediated inflammatory signaling may contribute to COVID-19 disease progression more so than TNF\u03b1-mediated inflammatory signaling. They also support the notion that, in COVID-19 inflammation, ADAM12 sheds ephrin-A1, while ADAM17 sheds TNF\u03b1. Furthermore, the results suggest that elevated serum levels and activity of cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1, and other secreted inflammatory molecules, such as ephrin-A1, are not simply due to overexpression, but also to upregulation of sheddases that release them into the blood circulation. Our results identify ephrin-A1, ADAM12, and other molecules in the ephrin-A1 signaling pathway as potential pharmacological targets for treating COVID-19 inflammation.

It is more pronounced when the preparations are constricted and is therefore termed hypoxic augmentation of vasoconstriction. This hypoxic response is accompanied by increases in the intracellular level of inosine 5\u2032-triphosphate and in the synthesis of inosine 3\u2032,5\u2032-cyclic monophosphate (cIMP) by soluble guanylyl cyclase. The administration of exogenous cIMP or inosine 5\u2032-triphosphate causes augmented vasoconstriction to hypoxia. Furthermore, the vasoconstriction evoked by hypoxia and cIMP is associated with increased activity of Rho kinase (ROCK), indicating that cIMP may mediate the hypoxic effect by sensitizing the myofilaments to Ca 2+ through ROCK. Hypoxia is implicated in exaggerated vasoconstriction in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, hypertension, and stroke. The newly found role of cIMP may help to identify unique therapeutic targets for certain cardiovascular disorders."

We hypothesized that the laparoscopic approach is an alternative for early GBC. To identify and evaluate the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic surgery in the treatment of early GBC. A comprehensive search of online databases, including MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane libraries, and Web of Science, was performed to identify non-comparative studies reporting the outcomes of laparoscopic surgery and comparative studies involving laparoscopic surgery and open surgery in early GBC from January 2009 to October 2019. A fixed-effects meta-analysis was performed for 1- and 5-year overall survival and postoperative complications, while 3-year overall survival, operation time, blood loss, the number of lymph node dissected, and postoperative hospital stay were analyzed by random-effects models. The review identified 7 comparative studies and 8 non-comparative studies. 1068 patients (laparoscopic surgery: 613; open surgery: 455) were included in the meta-analysis of 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival with no significant differences observed [(HR = 0.54; 95%CI: 0.29-1.00; I 2 = 0.0%; P = 0.051), (HR = 0.75; 95%CI: 0.34-1.65; I 2 = 60.7%; P = 0.474), (HR = 0.71; 95%CI: 0.47-1.08; I 2 = 49.6%; P = 0.107), respectively].

The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 has a highly flexible active site. Drug repurposing is a treatment opportunity in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Nine drugs merit testing as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The global emergency caused by COVID-19 makes the discovery of drugs capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 a priority, to reduce the mortality and morbidity of this disease. Repurposing approved drugs can provide therapeutic alternatives that promise rapid and ample coverage because they have a documented safety record, as well as infrastructure for large-scale production. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) is an excellent therapeutic target because it is critical for viral replication; however, Mpro has a highly flexible active site that must be considered when performing computer-assisted drug discovery. In this work, potential inhibitors of the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-Cov-2 were identified through a docking-assisted virtual screening procedure. A total of 4384 drugs, all approved for human use, were screened against three conformers of Mpro. The ligands were further studied through molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy analysis. A total of nine currently approved molecules are proposed as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. These molecules can be further tested to speed the development of therapeutics against COVID-19."

        "title": "Targeted Training of Ultrasonic Vocalizations in Aged and Parkinsonian Rats",
        "abstract": "Voice deficits are a common complication of both Parkinson disease (PD) and aging; they can significantly diminish quality of life by impacting communication abilities. 1, 2 Targeted training (speech/voice therapy) can improve specific voice deficits, 3, 4 although the underlying mechanisms of behavioral interventions are not well understood. Systematic investigation of voice deficits and therapy should consider many factors that are difficult to control in humans, such as age, home environment, age post-onset of disease, severity of disease, and medications. The method presented here uses an animal model of vocalization that allows for systematic study of how underlying sensorimotor mechanisms change with targeted voice training. The ultrasonic recording and analysis procedures outlined in this protocol are applicable to any investigation of rodent ultrasonic vocalizations. The ultrasonic vocalizations of rodents are emerging as a valuable model to investigate the neural substrates of behavior. 5-8 Both rodent and human vocalizations carry semiotic value and are produced by modifying an egressive airflow with a laryngeal constriction. 9, 10 Thus, rodent vocalizations may be a useful model to study voice deficits in a sensorimotor context. Further, rat models allow us to study the neurobiological underpinnings of recovery from deficits with targeted training. To model PD we use Long-Evans rats (Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.) and induce parkinsonism by a unilateral infusion of 7 \u03bcg of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle which causes moderate to severe degeneration of presynaptic striatal neurons (for details see Ciucci, 2010). 11, 12 For our aging model we use the Fischer 344/Brown Norway F1 (National Institute on Aging). Our primary method for eliciting vocalizations is to expose sexually-experienced male rats to sexually receptive female rats. When the male becomes interested in the female, the female is removed and the male continues to vocalize. By rewarding complex vocalizations with food or water, both the number of complex vocalizations and the rate of vocalizations can be increased (Figure 1). An ultrasonic microphone mounted above the male's home cage records the vocalizations. Recording begins after the female rat is removed to isolate the male calls. Vocalizations can be viewed in real time for training or recorded and analyzed offline. By recording and acoustically analyzing vocalizations before and after vocal training, the effects of disease and restoration of normal function with training can be assessed. This model also allows us to relate the observed behavioral (vocal) improvements to changes in the brain and neuromuscular system."

Although common in early childhood, intussusceptions are very rare in the adult population. Most intussusceptions in adults are due to a lead point, which is an identifiable pathological abnormality, in opposition to children which there are no identifiable pathological lead points. In contrast to childhood intussusception, in adults it is associated with malignant lesions, particularly in the large bowel rather than in the small bowel. Its preoperative diagnosis and treatment in adults is difficult because of nonspecific abdominal symptom and because it rarely presents with the classic triad of vomiting, abdominal pain and passage of blood per rectum. We present a 63-year-old female with an adenocarcinoma tumor being the lead point in a colocolic intussusception, who was diagnosed preoperatively with computed tomography and had a colonoscopy to rule out obstruction. She underwent right hemicolectomy with side-to-side ileocolic anastomosis and did well postoperatively. In addition, we also review the literature and discuss the value of radiological modalities, location and surgical management to try to improve the preoperative diagnosis. Computed tomography scanning with intravenous contrast is maybe the most accurate modality for diagnosis of intussusceptions in adults, and treatment is usually surgical resection without reduction, since most of the colonic lesions are malignant."

The Kyoto score is a sum of scores for atrophy (Kimura\u2010Takemoto atrophic\u2010border classification none or C1: 0, C\u2010II or C\u2010III: 1, O\u2010I to O\u2010III: 2), intestinal metaplasia (none: 0, antrum: 1, corpus and antrum: 2), enlarged folds (absence: 0, presence: 1), nodularity (absence: 0, presence: 1), and diffuse redness (none: 0, mild: 1, severe: 2) and ranges from 0 to 8. Eighty\u2010three patients (mean age: 54.9\u2009years; 65.1% women) were enrolled. The mean duration from successful eradication to surveillance EGD was 256\u2009days.

Scores for endoscopic atrophy (from 1.43 to 1.46, P = 0.638) and endoscopic intestinal metaplasia (from 0.53 to 0.47, P = 0.543) did not change; however, there was significant improvement in the scores for enlarged folds (from 0.14 to 0.00, P = 0.002), nodularity (from 0.18 to 0.04, P = 0.002), and diffuse redness (from 1.61 to 0.82, P <\u20090.001). The Kyoto classification score decreased following H. pylori eradication. A decrease in the scores for enlarged folds, nodularity, and diffuse redness contributed to the decrease in Kyoto score.  The Kyoto classification score on endoscopic gastritis (sum of scores for atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, enlarged folds, nodularity, and diffuse redness with or without regular arrangement of collecting venules) is associated with Helicobacter pylori infection status and gastric cancer risk. We found that the Kyoto classification score improved with H. pylori eradication. Improvement in the scores for enlarged folds, nodularity, and diffuse redness might be predictors for successful H. pylori eradication."

However, as both drugs require dosage adjustments that are difficult, VTE recurrences occur relatively frequently, and hemorrhagic complications are extremely common. The parenteral factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux and the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and apixaban have recently become available as treatments for VTE in Japan. These novel anticoagulants have more stable effects than traditional therapies and are thus considered safer and more effective than the traditional agents. Especially, DOACs offer improved long-term prevention of recurrence in patients with unprovoked VTE. The initiation of DOAC monotherapy soon after VTE onset leads to shorter hospital stays than required with the older therapies and allows for outpatient treatment. DOACs have additional benefits, such as safer anticoagulant therapy for cancer patients. These novel anticoagulants are extremely promising, but there is a current lack of evidence in areas such as dosing regimens for highly vulnerable patients and dosing for long-term use, and alternative regimens for each DOAC."

The identification of endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) in blood presented an opportunity to non-invasively obtain ECs 5-7 . We and other authors have shown that adult and cord blood-derived ECFCs have the capacity to form functional vascular networks in vivo  7-11 . Importantly, these studies have also shown that to obtain stable and durable vascular networks, ECFCs require co-implantation with perivascular cells. The assay we describe here illustrates this concept: we show how human cord blood-derived ECFCs can be combined with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a single cell suspension in a collagen/fibronectin/fibrinogen gel to form a functional human vascular network within 7 days after implantation into an immunodeficient mouse. The presence of human ECFC-lined lumens containing host erythrocytes can be seen throughout the implants indicating not only the formation ( de novo ) of a vascular network, but also the development of functional anastomoses with the host circulatory system. This murine model of bioengineered human vascular network is ideally suited for studies on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of human vascular network formation and for the development of strategies to vascularize engineered tissues."

        "abstract": "Service users are increasingly involved in the design of clinical trials and in product and device development. Service user involvement in placebo development is crucial to a credible and acceptable placebo for clinical trials, but such involvement has not yet been reported. To enhance the design of a future clinical trial of hand splints for thumb\u2010base osteoarthritis ( OA ), service users were involved in splint selection and design of a placebo splint. This article describes and reflects on this process. Two fora of service users were convened in 2011. Service users who had been prescribed a thumb splint for thumb\u2010base OA were approached about involvement by Occupational Therapy ( OT ) practitioners. A total of eight service users took part in the fora. Service users discussed their experience of OA and their own splints and then tried a variety of alternative splints. Through this they identified the active features of splints alongside acceptable and unacceptable design features. Service users focused on wearability and support with or without immobilization. Fora discussed whether a placebo group (\u2018arm\u2019) was an acceptable feature of a future trial, and service users developed a potential design for a placebo splint. This is the first project that to involve service users in placebo design. Service users are increasingly involved in product and device design and are ideally placed to identify features to make a placebo credible yet lacking key active ingredients. The future trial will include research into its acceptability."

SMC tries to autonomously mass customize and produce products per customer needs in Industry 4.0. SMC shown here is from the perspective of arriving at a CODP during manufacturing process flow designs meant for fast moving and complex product variants. Learning generally needs several repetitive cycles to break the complexity barrier. We make use of fruit fly and particle swarm optimization (PSO) evolutionary algorithms with the help of MATLAB programming to constantly search better fitting consecutive process modules in manufacturing chain. CODP is optimized by increasing modularity and reducing complexity through evolutionary concept. Learning-based PSO iterations are performed. The methods shown here are recommended for process flow design in a learning-oriented supply chain organization which can involve in-house and outsourced manufacturing steps. Finally, a complexity reduction model is presented which can aid in deploying this concept in design of supply chain and manufacturing flows.

We have found that the immunoreactivity of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), an important antioxidant enzyme, is high in mesothelioma compared to healthy pleural mesothelium. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether MnSOD can be used in the differential diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma and metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pleura. MnSOD expression was assessed by using immunohistochemistry in biopsies of malignant mesothelioma ( n = 35) and metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pleura ( n = 21). MnSOD immunoreactivity was assessed semiquantitatively with and without microwave pretreatment. Fifteen of the 35 malignant mesotheliomas showed moderate or strong MnSOD expression without and 23 with microwave pretreatment, the corresponding figures for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pleura being 1 and 2 out of 21 ( P = 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively by Fisher's exact test). Only mesothelioma biopsies showed strong MnSOD reactivity, and it was never negative in mesothelioma, whereas one-third of the adenocarcinomas showed no MnSOD reactivity. In conclusion, MnSOD immunoreactivity can, combined with other markers, aid the differential diagnosis between malignant mesothelioma and metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pleura. \u00a9 2000Cancer Research Campaign"

To evaluate the flexibility, microstructure and elemental analysis of four different recent NiTi rotary instruments, namely; Wave One Gold, TF adaptive, HyFlex EDM and Gr_Reciproc Blue compared to conventional Protaper Universal (F2). The NiTi rotary files were subjected to cantilever bending test to evaluate their flexibility. The microstructural characteristics and elemental analysis were examined via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The TF adaptive, HyFlex EDM and Wave One Gold endodontic files showed significantly lower cantilever bending values (i.e., higher flexibility) than Protaper F2 and Gr_Reciproc Blue (p < 0.05). The SEM micrographs showed that the bulk of all examined files showed multiple striations due to the cutting process, on the other hand, their external surfaces were different: The Protaper Universal F2 showed multiple voids, while the TF Adaptive surface exhibited more uniform structure. The Hyflex EDM had a crater-like surface, whereas Wave one Gold showed machining grooves with minimum defects, while Reciproc Blue displayed machining grooves with random scratch lines. There was a significant difference in bulk and surface elemental analysis of the various examined files, yet composed mainly of the same elements. Chemical composition, heat treatment, manufacturing process and geometrical design of the NiTi rotary instrument have a great influence on their flexibility and microstructure."

Due to the complex thalamic connection with cortical and subcortical regions, thalamus was divided into prefrontal (PFC), occipital (OC), premotor, primary motor, sensory, temporal, and posterior parietal association subregions according to white matter tractography. We adopted seven subregions of bilateral thalamus as regions of interest to systematically study the implications of distinct thalamic nuclei in acute abstinent HU. The volume and resting\u2010state functional connectivity (RSFC) differences of the thalamus were investigated between age\u2010, gender\u2010, and alcohol\u2010matched 37 HU and 33 healthy controls (HCs). Trail making test\u2010A (TMT\u2010A) was adopted to assess cognitive function deficits, which were then correlated with neuroimaging findings. Although no significant different volumes were found, HU group showed decreased RSFC between left PFC_thalamus and middle temporal gyrus as well as between left OC_thalamus and inferior frontal gyrus and supplementary motor area relative to HCs. Meanwhile, the higher TMT\u2010A scores in HU were negatively correlated with PFC_thalamic RSFC with inferior temporal gyrus, fusiform, and precuneus. Craving scores were negatively correlated with OC_thalamic RSFC with accumbens, hippocampus, and insula. Opiate Withdrawal Scale scores were negatively correlated with left PFC/OC_thalamic RSFC with orbitofrontal cortex and medial PFC. We indicated two thalamus subregions separately involvement in cognitive control and craving to reveal the implications of thalamic subnucleus in pathology of acute abstinent HU. We adopted seven subregions of bilateral thalamus as regions of interest to systematically study the implications of distinct thalamic nuclei in acute abstinent heroin users. We investigated the reduced resting\u2010state functional connectivity of thalamus subregions in acute abstinent heroin users, and then correlated with cognitive control and craving. "

Full thickness sections of 13 lower eyelids and 11 upper eyelids from seven Caucasian cadavers were examined. In the lower eyelids, all 13 specimens demonstrated clear overriding of preseptal OOM over the pretarsal OOM. The overriding part extended almost to the level of lower eyelid margin. However, in the upper eyelids, only one of the 11 eyelids demonstrated overriding, and the overriding part only extended to the level of mid-tarsal plate. Our result strongly supports the hypothesis of overriding of the preseptal OOM over the pretarsal OOM as an etiology of involutional lower eyelid entropion. The relatively low frequency of upper eyelid overriding preseptal OOM in our study reflects and may explain the rare occurrence of involutional upper eyelid entropion."

In the current study, we highlight miRNA\u2010204\u20105p, identified from this screen, and further studied its role in the regulation of skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. Following silencing of miRNA\u2010204\u20105p in C2C12 myotubes, gene and protein expression were assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, microarray analysis, and western blot analysis, while\u00a0morphological changes were studied by confocal microscopy. In addition, miRNA\u2010204\u20105p expression was quantified in human skeletal muscle biopsies and associated with in vivo mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Transcript levels of PGC\u20101\u03b1 (3.71\u2010fold; p <\u2009\u2009.01), predicted as an miR\u2010204\u20105p target, as well as mitochondrial DNA copy number ( p <\u2009\u2009.05) and citrate synthase activity ( p =\u2009\u2009.06) were increased upon miRNA\u2010204\u20105p silencing in C2C12 myotubes. Silencing of miRNA\u2010204\u20105p further resulted in morphological changes, induced gene expression of autophagy marker light chain 3 protein b (LC3B; q =\u2009\u2009.05), and reduced expression of the mitophagy marker FUNDC1 ( q =\u2009\u2009.01). Confocal imaging revealed colocalization between the autophagosome marker LC3B and the mitochondrial marker OxPhos upon miRNA\u2010204\u20105p silencing. Finally, miRNA\u2010204\u20105p was differentially expressed in human subjects displaying large variation in oxidative capacity and its expression levels associated with in vivo measures of skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. In summary, silencing of miRNA\u2010204\u20105p in C2C12 myotubes stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis, impacted on cellular morphology, and altered expression of markers related to autophagy and mitophagy. The association between miRNA\u2010204\u20105p and in vivo mitochondrial function in human skeletal muscle further identifies miRNA\u2010204\u20105p as an interesting modulator of skeletal muscle mitochondrial metabolism. Silencing of microRNA\u2010204\u20105p (miRNA\u2010204\u20105p) in C2C12 myotubes enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, via regulation of PGC\u20101\u03b1. In humans, low expression of miRNA\u2010204\u20105p in skeletal muscle was associated high oxidative capacity. These findings identify miRNA\u2010204\u20105p as an interesting modulator of mitochondrial function in human skeletal muscle. "

Up to now, locking plates (LP) and external fixation (EF) are two conventional surgical approaches to type C radius fracture. Which method is superior has not yet reached a consensus.

We used network to search the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Medical Library of randomized controlled clinical trials about the type C distal radius fractures performed according to the search strategy mentioned in Cochrane Handbook 5.1.0 from Jan. 2005 to Jan. 2016. Patients in the experimental group were used LP, in the control group were included EF and other surgical approaches. Publication language was restricted to English. Studies that patient population and surgical indication did not define had been excluded. Studies must report at least one of the outcomes as follow: radial inclination, palmar tilt, ulnar variance, range of wrist flexion and extension, and range of wrist supination and pronation. The trials in which participants included children were excluded. We used Jadad study scores to appraise the study. Seven studies included 162 patients (LP group) and 190 patients (EF group). We compared the radial inclination, palmar tilt, ulnar variance, range of wrist flexion and extension, and range of wrist supination and pronation. The radial inclination were revealed a difference favoring LP over EF [WMD\u00a0=\u00a01.84, 95% CI (0.17, 3.50), p =\u00a00.03] and the palmar tilt and ulnar variance was no significant difference between the two groups [(WMD\u00a0=\u00a03.61, 95% CI (0.00, 7.23), p =\u00a00.05; WMD\u00a0=\u00a00.05, 95% CI (\u22120.99, 1.09), p =\u00a00.93].

This is a case of ZES where preoperative localization revealed a gastrinoma in a solitary portacaval lymph node, presumed to be a primary lymph node gastrinoma. The patient is a 57 year old female diagnosed with ZES, suspected of having a primary lymph node gastrinoma. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy and excision of a portacaval lymph node with a frozen section which was positive for gastrinoma. Intraoperative sonography of the pancreas, upper endoscopy with transillumination of the duodenum, and a duodenotomy with bimanual examination of the duodenal wall were also performed. The patient was found to have a 4\u00a0mm duodenal mass near the pylorus, which was excised. Pathology showed that the duodenal mass was primary gastrinoma. Serum gastrin levels taken four months postoperatively were normal and the repeat octreotide scan did not show any evidence of recurrence. Primary lymph node gastrinoma is a diagnosis of exclusion.

Four cylindrical columns containing different concentrations of nanoparticles ranging from 0.01% to 0.09% by weight (wt%) were placed in a 5 cm diameter cylindrical water phantom. The images of the columns had detectable contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of 5.7 and 4.3 for 0.01 wt% Gd and for 0.03 wt% Au, respectively. Higher concentrations of nanoparticles yielded higher CNR. For 1\u00d710 11 incident particles, the radiation dose to the phantom was 19.9 mGy for 110 kVp X-rays (Gd imaging) and 26.1 mGy for 140 kVp X-rays (Au imaging).

Although diabetes is considered a microvascular disease, recent studies have shown that neurodegeneration precedes vascular changes within the diabetic visual system, albeit its mechanisms are still under investigation. Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are intrinsically related phenomena, since macrophage/microglia and astrocytes are the main sources of reactive oxygen species during central nervous system chronic degenerative diseases, and both pathological processes are increased in the visual system during diabetes. The present review will focus on recent findings of the contribution of oxidative stress derived from neuroinflammation in the early neurodegenerative aspects of the diabetic visual system and their relationship with galectin-3."

        "abstract": "Despite the increasing prevalence of fatty liver diseases worldwide, the molecular mechanism underlying their pathogenesis remains poorly defined. This study examines the expression and significance of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) in the high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mouse obesity model and the oleic acid/palmitic acid (OA/PA)-induced cell model. After developing these models, we measured the expressions of TRAF6, enhancer of the zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1). The expression of TRAF6, EZH2, and PPAR\u03b1 was manipulated to investigate their roles in cholesterol accumulation through evaluating the plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) assay was used to determine the interaction between TRAF6 and EZH2 and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to detect the enrichment of EZH2 and H3K27me3 in microRNA-429 (miR-429) promoter. We found that HFD resulted in elevated TRAF6 and miR-429 in fatty liver and reduced EZH2 and PPAR\u03b1. TRAF6 mediated the ubiquitination of EZH2 and increased miR-429 expression, and miR-429 targeted PPAR\u03b1. TRAF6 increased cholesterol accumulation in liver cells in\u00a0vitro via the EZH2/miR-429/PPAR\u03b1 axis. Collectively, HFD upregulates TRAF6 and ubiquitinates EZH2 to promote the miR-429-dependent inhibition of PPAR\u03b1, leading to cholesterol accumulation in liver and the occurrence of fatty liver. This paper proposes that a HFD enhanced TRAF6 expression in the liver and TRAF6 increased cholesterol accumulation in liver cells via the EZH2/miR-429/PPAR\u03b1 axis.

A total of 814 school children under 5 years were selected from 5 government and 5 private schools in Chennai city, Tamil Nadu, India, and their occlusion was recorded based on the terminal planes. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16 software. Frequency distribution and Chi-square test were carried out. The most common occlusion seen in the present study was flush terminal plane (54.05%). Of them, 43.73% had mesial step and 2.08% had distal step. There was no significant difference between males and females. The signs of future malocclusion are found to be high. Hence, early preventive and interceptive measures are necessary to reduce the prevalence of future developing malocclusion and further adverse effects. Anu V, Pavani B, Pavani D, et al.

        "abstract": "Supplemental digital content is available in the text. Despite numerous efforts to create more equitable healthcare systems, minority populations face long-standing health disparities compared to White populations. Healthcare research is the necessary foundation for creating equitable health systems and providing patient-centered care. Significant challenges exist, however, with recruiting and engaging underrepresented populations in clinical research. The purpose of this analysis was to determine how research participants' race, trust, and level of education influence participation barriers in clinical research. The study used secondary, cross-sectional survey data that were collected between 2014 and 2016 through the former Mid-South Clinical Data Research Network, currently known as the Stakeholders, Technology, and Research Clinical Research Network. Descriptive statistics and Spearman rank correlations were performed between level of education, level of trust, and each attitude statement for each racial category. A total of 2,190 survey responses were used in the data analysis. The mean age of respondents was 52 years, with majority being women, White, insured, and working full time. Overall, the respondents had favorable attitudes toward research participation. Trust was correlated with agreement in many attitude statements for both White and African American respondents, whereas correlations with education level were more variable depending on racial grouping. Trust level was negatively associated with agreement toward the statement \u201cresearchers do not care about me\u201d in White and Native American respondents. The results support the importance of trust to research participation. Generally, education level was not strongly predictive of research participation, although prediction was influenced by race and attitude."

HCWs at a tertiary referral hospital in Seoul, South Korea, received a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) or an mRNA-based vaccine (BNT162b2) between March 5 and March 26, 2021. The HCWs were asked to report adverse reactions through a mobile self-report questionnaire for three days after vaccination. A total of 7,625 HCWs received the first dose of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccine during the study period. Of them, 5,866 (76.9%) HCWs (ChAdOx1, n = 5,589 [95.3%]; BNT162b2, n = 277 [4.7%]) participated at least once in the survey, of whom 77% were female and 86% were younger than 50 years. The overall adverse reaction rate was 93% in the ChAdOx1 group and 80% in the BNT162b2 group ( P < 0.001). Both local and systemic reactions were more commonly reported in the ChAdOx1 group, and the difference was larger in systemic reactions such as fever and fatigue. In the ChAdOx1 group, the incidence of adverse reactions was significantly higher in females and those in the younger age groups, while the BNT162b2 group showed such difference according to age. In our prospective survey, vaccine-associated adverse reactions were more commonly reported in the ChAdOx1 group than in the BNT162b2 group. Females and younger age groups experienced vaccine-associated adverse reactions more frequently."

Non-anticoagulation dosage of rivaroxaban could provide an effective therapy to attenuate early phases of heart failure development. Activated factor X is a key component of the coagulation cascade, but whether it directly regulates pathological cardiac remodeling is unclear. In mice subjected to pressure overload stress, cardiac factor X mRNA expression and activity increased concurrently with cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, inflammation and diastolic dysfunction, and responses blocked with a low coagulation-independent dose of rivaroxaban. In vitro, neurohormone stressors increased activated factor X expression in both cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts, resulting in activated factor X-mediated activation of protease-activated receptors and pro-hypertrophic and -fibrotic responses, respectively. Thus, inhibition of cardiac-expressed activated factor X could provide an effective therapy for the prevention of adverse cardiac remodeling in hypertensive patients."

Likewise, Enugu State has developed a draft policy on PPP since 2005. However, non-validation and non-implementation of this policy might have led to loss of interest in the partnership. The aim of this study was to provide evidence for planning the implementation of PPP in Enugu State health system via a multi-sectoral identification of challenges, constraints and prospects. Pre-tested questionnaires were administered to 466 respondents (251 health workers and 215 community members), selected by multi-stage sampling method from nine Local Government Areas of Enugu State, Nigeria, over a study period of April 2011 to September 2011. Data from the questionnaires were collated manually and quantitative data analyzed using SPSS version 15 (Chicago, IL, USA). Only 159 (34.1%, 159/466) of all respondents actually understood the meaning of PPP though 251 (53.9%) of them had claimed knowledge of the concept. This actual understanding was higher among health workers (57.8%, 145/251) when compared with the community members (6.5%, 14/215) ( P < 0.001). Post-PPP enlightenment reviews showed a more desire for PPP implementation among private health-care workers (89.4%, 101/113) and community leaders/members (55.4%, 119/215). PPP in health-care delivery in Enugu State is feasible with massive awareness, elaborate stakeholder's engagements and well-structured policy before implementation. A critical challenge will be to convince the public sector workers who are the anticipated partners to accept and support private sector participation."

In Canada before 2005, large outbreaks of pneumococcal disease, including invasive pneumococcal disease caused by serotype 5, were rare. Since then, an epidemic of serotype 5 invasive pneumococcal disease was reported: 52 cases during 2005, 393 during 2006, 457 during 2007, 104 during 2008, and 42 during in 2009. Of these 1,048 cases, 1,043 (99.5%) occurred in the western provinces of Canada. Median patient age was 41 years, and most (659 [59.3%]) patients were male. Most frequently representing serotype 5 cases (compared with a subset of persons with non\u2013serotype 5 cases) were persons who were of First Nations heritage or homeless. Restriction fragment-length polymorphism typing indicated that the epidemic was caused by a single clone, which multilocus sequence typing identified as sequence type 289. Large pneumococcal epidemics might go unrecognized without surveillance programs to document fluctuations in serotype prevalence."

The records of 80 patients, aged 31\u201382 years (39 males and 41 females), who had undergone median nerve decompression using open and endoscopic release surgery, were reviewed. Peripheral electrodiagnostic studies were performed in all patients prior to surgery. Those whose nonmedian nerve-related symptoms, also known as musculoskeletal and soft tissue pain and tenderness, persisted postoperatively, were referred to another electrodiagnostic study to reassess the median nerve function at the carpal tunnel. Peripheral electrodiagnostic studies were deemed unnecessary for patients with exclusively median nerve-related symptoms who improved dramatically following surgery. Included from the study were cases whose presenting symptoms were primarily referrable to median nerve dysfunction with or without associated musculoskeletal pain. Cases that were excluded were those whose symptoms were related to various primary conditions. Outcome of surgery was reviewed and correlated with symptoms related to median nerve compression and musculoskeletal irritation, and with electrodiagnostic abnormalities. Complete resolution of symptoms, following surgery, occurred in patients with clinical and electrophysiologic signs of median nerve compression but without significant symptoms of musculoskeletal irritation. Those with concurrent and prominent musculoskeletal and soft tissue pain had variable results, both favorable and unfavorable, including three who developed signs and symptoms of complex regional pain syndrome. The symptoms related to median nerve compression at the carpal tunnel and the symptoms related to musculoskeletal and soft tissue irritation are two different symptom complexes that have important diagnostic and therapeutic considerations. We would like to propose that \u201ctrue carpal tunnel syndrome\u201d symptoms, those that are exclusively median nerve related, should be considered a distinct entity. When musculoskeletal and soft tissue pain is more prominent and dominates the overall clinical presentation, the term \u201cmechanical stress syndrome\u201d is more appropriate."

The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a key role in modulating function and phenotype of the embedded cells and contains the integrins as adhesion receptors mediating cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013matrix interactions. In our study, characteristic changes in integrin expression during the course of chondrogenic differentiation of MSC from bone marrow and foetal cord blood were compared. MSC were isolated from bone marrow biopsies and cord blood. During cell culture, chondrogenic differentiation was performed. The expression of integrins and their signalling components were analysed with microarray and immunohistochemistry in freshly isolated MSC and after chondrogenic differentiation. The fibronectin-receptor (integrin a5b1) was expressed by undifferentiated MSC, expression rose during chondrogenic differentiation in both types of MSC. The components of the vitronectin/osteopontin-receptors (avb5) were not expressed by freshly isolated MSC, expression rose with ongoing differentiation. Receptors for collagens (a1b1, a2b1, a3b1) were weakly expressed by undifferentiated MSC and were activated during differentiation. As intracellular signalling components integrin linked kinase (ILK) and CD47 showed increasing expression with ongoing differentiation. For all integrins, no significant differences could be found in the two types of MSC. Integrin-mediated signalling seems to play an important role in the generation and maintenance of the chondrocytic phenotype during chondrogenic differentiation. Especially the receptors for fibronectin, vitronectin, osteopontin and collagens might be involved in the generation of the ECM. Intracellularly, their signals might be transduced by ILK and CD47. To fully harness the potential of these cells, future studies should be directed to ascertain their cellular and molecular characteristics for optimal identification, isolation and expansion."

This study investigated prehypertension and hypertension as well as the relevant factors affecting the development of these conditions in workers at elderly welfare facilities. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 242 workers at 3 elderly welfare facilities in northern Taiwan. A structured questionnaire survey comprising demographic characteristics, job characteristics, burnout inventory, and health information was employed for data collection. Chi-Squared tests and multinomial logistic regression were adopted to analyze the correlation between research variables and blood pressures as well as relevant factors influencing prehypertension and hypertension. The results indicated that sex, age, education level, type of work shift, work-related burnout, and body mass index of the research participants were significantly correlated with prehypertension and hypertension. The results of multinominal logistic regression demonstrated that being male, being older, being a nonnurse assistant, being obese, working in shifts, and having moderate or severe work-related burnout were associated with higher risks of prehypertension and hypertension. The interaction between age and being a nonnurse assistant was statistically significant. Compared with nonnurse assistants, nurse assistants aged \u226555\u200ayears had a relatively low risk of prehypertension and hypertension. Age, job characteristics, work-related burnout, and obesity of workers in elderly welfare facilities were the major risk factors for prehypertension and hypertension."

In this study, the expression pattern of two interferon-related microRNAs, miR-146a and miR-155, was examined in healthy and HCV-genotype-4-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using qRT-PCR. In contrast to other viral infections, the expression pattern was similar in both healthy and infected PBMCs. This could be attributed to attenuation of IFN pathway by HCV, which was assessed by investigating the expression of MxA, an interferon-stimulated gene, that showed lower expression in HCV-infected PBMCs. To determine the site of interference of HCV in the IFN pathway, expression of both microRNAs was examined following stimulation of PBMCs with IFN-\u03b12a, an activator of the JAK/STAT pathway as well as with imiquimod, a toll-like receptor-7 (TLR-7) agonist that promotes interferon release. IFN stimulation induced the expression of miR-146a and miR-155 in HCV-infected and healthy PBMCs. Stimulation with imiquimod led to a down-regulation of both microRNAs in infected PBMCs, while it increased their expression in healthy PBMCs, indicating that HCV might interfere with miR-146a and miR-155 expression at sites upstream of interferon release, specifically in the TLR-7 pathway. The pattern of expression of both miR-146a and miR-155 was very similar with a strong positive correlation, but showed no correlation to the patients\u2019 clinical or histopathological parameters or response to treatment. In conclusion, HCV infection might repress the induction of miR-146a and miR-155 by interfering with TLR-7 signaling. \u25b8 Repressed induction of miR-146a and miR-155 in PBMCs of HCV-infected patients. \u25b8 A strong positive correlation exists between expression of miR-146a and miR-155. \u25b8 TLR-7 activation suppresses miR-146a and miR-155 in PBMCs of HCV-infected patients. \u25b8 JAK/STAT pathway activation induces miR-146a and miR-155 in HCV infection."

However, no studies to date have assessed the use of the more readily available Wii Stillness Score (WSS) as a measure of balance. Twenty-four individuals without lower limb pathology performed a combination of unilateral and double leg standing balance tests with eyes open or closed on two separate occasions. At each session, data from the WBB were acquired on a laptop computer running custom software and then by Wii-Fit software on a Wii console. The reliability of the WSS was determined by assessing reproducibility, while the validity of the WSS was determined by comparing the results of the WSS to that of the custom-written software. We found that the WSS exhibited excellent intra and inter device reliability in three out of four stances tested. The Bland-Altman plots also showed good concurrent validity for the three analysed stances. However, there remain significant limitations with the use of the WSS such as its rigid thirty-second time parameter and single score result. The readily available WBB may be a used as a portable and inexpensive device to assess standing balance with custom written software. However, with the current limitations of the WSS, we would discourage its use as a clinical measure of balance."

TCs and MSCs were cultured in vitro and cell morphology was observed with a light microscope. The expression levels of CD34, c-kit, and vimentin were detected by immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR, and Western blotting in both TCs and MSCs. The related supernatant was collected and total of 49 cytokine profiles were detected by RayBio Mice Cytokine Antibody Array. Significantly different cytokines were further confirmed by ELISA. TCs have small cellular body and very long prolongations and they were CD34 + /c-kit + /vimentin + , whereas MSCs have no telopodes and they were CD34 \u2013 /c-kit \u2013 /vimentin + . Cytokine profile analysis and ELISA showed that 19 of 49 cytokines were increased dramatically in the supernatant of TCs compared with those of MSCs. Moreover, 9 of 19 cytokines were increased 2-fold at least in the supernatant of TCs compared with those of MSCs. Of 49 cytokines, 30 exhibited no significant changes in the supernatant of TCs compared with those of MSCs. Using various technologies, we identified that myocardial TCs and MSCs are significantly different in terms of cell structure and cytokine profiles."

        "abstract": "The introduction of a new and rapid molecular diagnostic for tuberculosis (TB) and rifampicin resistance (RIF) in the national TB program has improved the diagnosis of TB by shortening the turnaround time and detecting the presence of RIF resistance in high TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) settings such as Ethiopia. However, the implementation of this new diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis (MTB ) and rifampicin (RIF) resistance in clinical setting is limited known in the country. Hence, this study intended to describe the program of GeneXpert MTB/RIF in the diagnosis of TB and RIF in high HIV setting in Gambella Regional State, Southwest Ethiopia. Institutional based retrospective study was conducted among presumptive TB patients diagnosed with GeneXpert assay in the last three years (2015\u20132017) in Gambella Hospital from May 1\u201330, 2017. The data were collected from GeneXpert registration book using standard data extraction sheet. The data were entered and cleared using EPI data 3.1 and then, exported and analyzed using SPSS version 20.0 statistical software package. Of the 995 presumptive TB patients who received the GeneXpert test in the last three years, 20.0% (95% CI: 17.4\u201322.7) of them had proven MTB detection while 4.9% (95% CI: 2.2\u20138.1) had RIF resistance. The prevalence of RIF resistance was 2.3% and 14.3% among the new and retreated cases respectively. There was also a 35.5% TB/HIV co-infections. The odd of MTB detection was higher among 15\u201329 [AOR 2.17 (95% CI: 1.25- 3.76)] and 30\u201344 [AOR 2.35 (95% CI: 1.36\u20134.07)] year old participants. The figure was however significantly lower among female [AOR 0.64 (95% CI: 0.45\u20130.91)] and unknown HIV status [AOR 0.38(95% CI: 0.24\u20130.61)] participants of the study. In addition, the odd of RIF resistance was significantly low among HIV unknown case [AOR 0.14 (95% CI: 0.02\u20130.96)]. It was also learnt that there was progressively decline of invalid or error Xpert result from 4.7% to 2.0% in the course of the study period (X 2 , 25.54; P\u202f=\u202f0.001). The study confirms the high prevalence of TB, RIF resistance and TB/HIV co-infection among the study participants. Age, sex, and HIV status of the study participants were predictor factors for MTB detection while HIV status was associated with RIF resistance. Therefore, the results of the study indicate that there is the need for collaborative and intensified prevention of TB and HIV in the study area. The ongoing supervision and mentoring to improve the performance of Xpert in the institution need to be promoted."

        "abstract": "Antiplatelet resistance is emerging as a significant factor in effective secondary stroke prevention. Prevalence of aspirin and clopidogrel resistance is dependent upon laboratory test and remains contentious. Large studies in cardiovascular disease populations have demonstrated worse ischemic outcomes in patients with antiplatelet resistance, particularly in patients with coronary stents. Thromboembolism is a complication of neurointerventional procedures that leads to stroke. Stroke rates related to aneurysm coiling range from 2 to 10% and may be higher when considering silent ischemia. Stroke associated with carotid stenting is a major cause of morbidity. Antiplatelet use in the periprocedure setting varies among different centers. No guidelines exist for use of antiplatelet regimens in neurointerventional procedures. Incidence of stroke in patients post procedure may be partly explained by resistance to antiplatelet agents. Further research is required to establish the incidence of stroke in patients with antiplatelet resistance undergoing neurointerventional procedures."

        "abstract": "This prospective study of cellulitis identified \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci as the dominating cause in all investigated subgroups. Group C/G streptococci were more frequently detected than group A streptococci. No single clinical feature substantially increased the probability of confirmed streptococcal etiology. Background. We determined the feasibility of using computer vision and depth sensing to detect healthcare worker (HCW)-patient contacts to estimate both hand hygiene (HH) opportunities and personal protective equipment (PPE) adherence. Methods. We used multiple Microsoft Kinects to track the 3-dimensional movement of HCWs and their hands within hospital rooms. We applied computer vision techniques to recognize and determine the position of fiducial markers attached to the patient's bed to determine the location of the HCW's hands with respect to the bed. To measure our system's ability to detect HCW-patient contacts, we counted each time a HCW's hands entered a virtual rectangular box aligned with a patient bed. To measure PPE adherence, we identified the hands, torso, and face of each HCW on room entry, determined the color of each body area, and compared it with the color of gloves, gowns, and face masks. We independently examined a ground truth video recording and compared it with our system's results. Results. Overall, for touch detection, the sensitivity was 99.7%, with a positive predictive value of 98.7%. For gowned entrances, sensitivity was 100.0% and specificity was 98.15%. For masked entrances, sensitivity was 100.0% and specificity was 98.75%; for gloved entrances, the sensitivity was 86.21% and specificity was 98.28%. Conclusions. Using computer vision and depth sensing, we can estimate potential HH opportunities at the bedside and also estimate adherence to PPE. Our fine-grained estimates of how and how often HCWs interact directly with patients can inform a wide range of patient-safety research."

The well-separated three main components, i.e., cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, are considered significant candidates for replacing and improving on oil-based chemicals and materials. The production of nanocellulose from wood pulp opens an opportunity for novel material development and applications in nanotechnology. Currently, increased research efforts are focused on developing 3D printing techniques for wood-derived biopolymers for use in emerging application areas, including as biomaterials for various biomedical applications and as novel composite materials for electronics and energy devices. This Review highlights recent work on emerging applications of wood-derived biopolymers and their advanced composites with a specific focus on customized pharmaceutical products and advanced functional biomedical devices prepared via three-dimensional printing. Specifically, various biofabrication strategies in which woody biopolymers are used to fabricate customized drug delivery devices, cartilage implants, tissue engineering scaffolds and items for other biomedical applications are discussed. This Review summarizes the current state-of-the-art approaches to utilize wood-derived biopolymers in fabricating personalized pharmaceutical products or biodevices via 3D printing."

        "abstract": "Gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in not only the gastrointestinal (GI) immune system but also GI motility and metabolism. Antibiotic treatments are likely to affect the gut flora and GI immune system, subsequently disturbing GI motility and body metabolism. In the present study, we investigated antibiotic-induced alterations of body metabolism and GI motility in association with the macrophage profile in the colon. Specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice (ICR; 6 weeks old; female) were orally administered vancomycin (0.2 mg/ml) in drinking water for 5 weeks, and subsequent changes in pathophysiology were observed. The expression of CD80 and CD163 was examined by immunohistochemistry and the expression of cytokines in colonic tissues was evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The gastrointestinal transit time (GITT) was measured by administration of carmine red (6% w/v) solution. In the vancomycin-treated SPF mice, significant increases in body weight, cecum weight and GITT were observed compared with the controls. The number of CD80-positive M1 macrophages and the expression of interferon -\u03b3 and interleukin-12 were significantly increased, whereas, the numbers of CD163-positive M2 macrophages in the mucosal and muscular layers were decreased in the colon of vancomycin-treated mice. GITT was positively correlated with the number of CD80-positive M1 macrophages in the colonic mucosa; however, was negatively correlated with the number of CD163-positive M2 macrophages in the mucosal and muscular layers. Therefore, it was suggested that antibiotic treatment affects body metabolism and GI motility, accompanied by alterations in macrophage polarization and cytokine profiles in the colon."

New lethal animal models for SARS were needed to facilitate antiviral research. We adapted and characterized a new strain of SARS-CoV (strain v2163) that was highly lethal in 5- to 6-week-old BALB/c mice. It had nine mutations affecting 10 amino acid residues. Strain v2163 increased IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, MIP-1\u03b1, MCP-1, and RANTES in mice, and high IL-6 expression correlated with mortality. The infection largely mimicked human disease, but lung pathology lacked hyaline membrane formation. In vitro efficacy against v2163 was shown with known inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication. In v2163-infected mice, Ampligen\u2122 was fully protective, stinging nettle lectin (UDA) was partially protective, ribavirin was disputable and possibly exacerbated disease, and EP128533 was inactive. Ribavirin, UDA, and Ampligen\u2122 decreased IL-6 expression. Strain v2163 provided a valuable model for anti-SARS research."

Collagen cross-linking was performed on 97 eyes. We assessed uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Corneal topography indices were evaluated using placido disc topography, scanning slit anterior topography (Orbscan II), and rotating Scheimpflug topography (Pentacam). Specular microscopy and corneal biomechanics were evaluated. A 1-year-follow-up results revealed that UCVA improved from 0.31 to 0.45 and BCVA changed from 0.78 to 0.84 ( P < 0.001). The mean of average keratometry value decreased from 49.62 to 47.95 D ( P < 0.001). Astigmatism decreased from 4.84 to 4.24 D ( P < 0.001). Apex corneal thickness decreased from 458.11 to 444.46 \u03bcm. Corneal volume decreased from 56.66 to 55.97 mm 3 ( P < 0.001). Posterior best fit sphere increased from 55.50 to 46.03 mm ( P = 0.025). Posterior elevation increased from 99.2 to 112.22 \u03bcm ( P < 0.001).

Endothelial coefficient of variation (CV) increased nonsignificantly from 18.26 to 20.29 ( P = 0.112). Corneal hysteresis changed from 8.18 to 8.36 ( P = 0.552) and corneal resistance factor increased from 6.98 to 7.21 ( P = 0.202), so these changes were not significant. Visual acuity and K values improved after CXL. In spite of the nonsignificant increase in endothelial cell count and increase in the CV, CLX seems to be a safe treatment for keratoconus. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are recommended."

The aim of this study was to identify pathways associated with chronic demyelination using an assumption-free combined microarray and immunohistology approach. Movement control as determined by rotarod assay significantly worsened in Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis -virus-infected SJL/J mice from 42 to 196 days after infection (dpi). In the spinal cords, inflammatory changes were detected 14 to 196 dpi, and demyelination progressively increased from 42 to 196 dpi. Microarray analysis revealed 1001 differentially expressed genes over the study period. The dominating changes as revealed by k -means and functional annotation clustering included up-regulations related to intrathecal antibody production and antigen processing and presentation via major histocompatibility class II molecules. A random forest machine learning algorithm revealed that down-regulated lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis, differentially expressed neurite morphogenesis and up-regulated toll-like receptor-4-induced pathways were intimately associated with demyelination as measured by immunohistology. Conclusively, although transcriptional changes were dominated by the adaptive immune response, the main pathways associated with demyelination included up-regulation of toll-like receptor 4 and down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis. Cholesterol biosynthesis is a rate limiting step of myelination and its down-regulation is suggested to be involved in chronic demyelination by an inhibition of remyelination."

To expedite the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in the national immunisation programme, a simple, ecological method to monitor changes in the burden of rotavirus disease may be of great help. Here, we report an application of a time-series analysis on a publicly-available dataset in Japan on the weekly number of laboratory-confirmed rotavirus-positive samples over the last 5 year period between the 36th week of 2009 and the 35th week of 2014 during which rotavirus vaccines became marketed in Japan and presumed to reach an uptake rate of at least 39% as a national average. Compared with the expected number of rotavirus detection based on the preceding four rotavirus seasons, the number of rotavirus detection during the 2013\u20132014 season was 42.9% (95% CI: 38.6, 47.8). This suggests that the use of rotavirus vaccine had a positive impact on reducing the burden of rotavirus diarrhoea in Japan. This method, because of its simplicity and little cost, should be applicable to early detection of the impact of rotavirus vaccine even in resource-poor countries where the World Health Organization funded and implemented the sentinel surveillance programmes of laboratory-confirmed rotavirus cases."

Adherence to the DASH diet has been shown to be effective for controlling hypertension, but it is unclear whether a hypertension diagnosis has an impact on adherence to the diet and nutrient intake. This study examined the association between hypertension diagnosis and the DASH nutrient intake using the multivariate linear regression method. The sample was composed of individuals with hypertension in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2007 to 2012. The outcome was the DASH accordance score (0 to 9 points), which measures the intake of nine nutrients compared to target amounts. Study findings indicate that a diagnostic status of hypertension was associated with increased consumption of sodium, saturated fat, total fat, and protein. Adherence to the DASH diet was more likely to be associated with health conditions such as obesity and heart diseases and lifestyle behaviors such as current smoking status and physical activity. Individuals diagnosed with hypertension showed less adherence to the DASH diet than those not diagnosed with hypertension, so a diagnosis of hypertension did not seem to provide an incentive to engage in healthy dietary behavior. Overall, regardless of diagnostic status, individuals with hypertension did not seem to follow the DASH guidelines."

Bird-level (prevalence among individual birds) H5 seroprevalence was 2.6% for ducks and 0.5% for chickens in contact with ducks. At least 1 seropositive bird was detected during 19.5% and 2.0% of duck- and chicken-flock visits, respectively. Duck flocks were 12.4\u00d7 more likely than chicken flocks to have seropositive birds. During 21.4% of farm visits, \u22651 sampled duck was H5 seropositive when all sampled in-contact chickens were seronegative. Subtype H5 virus was detected during 2.5% of duck-flock visits and 1.5% of chicken-flock visits. When deaths from HPAI infection occurred, H5 virus shedding occurred in apparently healthy birds on 68.8% of farms. Of 180 poultry deaths investigated, 43.9% were attributed to H5 virus. These longitudinal study results indicate that ducks are a source of infection for chickens and, potentially, for humans."

In sepsis patients, lncRNA CRNDE positively correlated with acute pathologic and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, as well as serum creatinine (Scr). As for inflammation, lncRNA CRNDE positively correlated with C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1), interleukin (IL)\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, and IL\u20108. Regarding mortality, lncRNA CRNDE positively correlated with 28\u2010days mortality. Furthermore, lncRNA CRNDE positively correlated with TLR3, and TLR3 positively associated with APACHE II score, SOFA score, Scr, albumin, CRP, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, IL\u20108, and 28\u2010days mortality in sepsis patients. LncRNA CRNDE interacts with TLR3, both of which correlate with advanced disease severity, inflammation, and higher 28\u2010days mortality in sepsis patients."

        "abstract": "Because gastrointestinal tract is not sterile, primary culture has contamination risk despite of massive washing with antimicrobial media. Microbial contamination can play a key role in initial failure during biopsy-derived primary tumor culture. Tumor tissue was acquired from esophageal and gastric tumors using endoscopic biopsy. Three-dimensional cultures were performed, and separated spheroids were cultured in media for 7 to 10 days and then transferred to Matrigel (Corning Inc.). We investigated risk factors and patterns of initial fungal contamination. Initial tumor contamination was observed in 23% (7/30) of esophageal cancer and 20% (3/15) of gastric cancer samples. Two cases of bacterial contamination occurred during the establishment of culture protocol. Moderate to thick whitish plaques ( p < 0.001) and food retention in lumen ( p < 0.001) were risk factors for initial fungal contamination. After exclusion of high risk patients for contamination, no fungal contamination occurred in primary organoid cultures. Fungal contamination was usually detected within 3 days after tumor preparation. However, unusual fungal contamination (GC11 and EC29) was recognized after several passages. Growing spherical shapes resembled cancer organoids. Although they rapidly proliferated and multiple daughter spheroids appeared, the media were translucent. After several passages, yeasts and pseudohyphae were detected on the edges of the solid spherical structures and media. Moderate to thick whitish plaques and food retention are clinical risk factors for initial fungal contamination during biopsy-derived cancer organoid culture. Most initial fungal contamination was detected within 3 days, but it could be unusually recognized after several passages."

        "abstract": "The term \u201cpalliative care\u201d has a negative connotation and may act as a barrier to early patient referrals. Rebranding has thus been proposed as a strategy to reduce the negative perceptions associated with palliative care. For example, using the term \u201csupportive care\u201d instead of \u201cpalliative care\u201d in naming palliative care units has been proposed in several studies. In Taiwan, terms other than \u201cpalliative\u201d and \u201chospice\u201d are already widely used in the names of palliative care units. With this in mind, this study investigated the characteristics of palliative care unit names in order to better understand the role of naming in palliative care. Relevant data were collected from the Taiwan Academy of Hospice Palliative Medicine, the National Health Insurance Administration of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the open database maintained by the government of Taiwan. We found a clear phenomenon of avoiding use of the terms \u201cpalliative\u201d and \u201chospice\u201d in the naming of palliative care units, a phenomenon that reflects the stigma attached to the terms \u201cpalliative\u201d and \u201chospice\u201d in Taiwan. At the time of the study (September, 2016), there were 55 palliative care units in Taiwan. Only 20.0% (n = 11) of the palliative care unit names included the term \u201cpalliative,\u201d while 25.2% (n = 14) included the term \u201chospice.\u201d Religiously affiliated hospitals were less likely to use the terms \u201cpalliative\u201d and \u201chospice\u201d (\u03c7 2 = 11.461, P = .001). There was also a lower prevalence of use of the terms \u201cpalliative\u201d and \u201chospice\u201d for naming palliative care units in private hospitals than in public hospitals (\u03c7 2 = 4.61, P = .032). This finding highlights the strong stigma attached to the terms \u201cpalliative\u201d and \u201chospice\u201d in Taiwan. It is hypothesized that sociocultural and religious factors may partially account for this phenomenon."

        "abstract": "The global COVID-19 pandemic has produced a variety of unanticipated shocks to farming and socio-economic systems around the world. In case of Senegal, the country was already facing number of challenges at the inception of the pandemic, including high rates of poverty, prevalence of food insecurity, combined with other biophysical and socioeconomic challenges faced generally in Sub-Saharan Africa. To understand farmer perceptions of the potential impacts of COVID-19 on agricultural systems and social well-being of smallholder farmers in Senegal. Particular attention was given to potential vulnerabilities and resilience in the targeted farming systems. A survey was developed to better understand smallholder farmer perceptions regarding the anticipated impacts of COVID-19 on their agriculture practices and social well-being. The survey was administered (between June 5 and June 20) with smallholder farmers ( n =\u00a0872) in 14 regions covering all agroecological zones. Variables of interest included perceptions of potential impact on farming systems, agricultural productivity, communities, economics, markets, labor, gendered division of labor, food security, and community well-being. Across the three farming systems examined (cropping, livestock, and horticulture) significant majorities expressed concerns related to access to inputs, ability to plant (cropping, horticulture), reduction of yields (cropping, horticulture), ability to feed livestock, ability to sell livestock, and the ability to hire labor (horticulture). The majority of respondents also expressed concern that COVID-19 would make it more difficult to get enough food on a regular basis for their household (82.5%); that the markets where they purchase food will either be closed or significantly disrupted (79.5%); that the price of food would increase (73.5%); and the market where they sell their produce/livestock will be either closed or significantly disrupted (73.2%). Anticipated impacts of COVID-19 on agriculture will be felt on both the biophysical aspects such as production and access to inputs and socioeconomic aspects such as access to labor, markets, or rapid shifts in demand. Results support the need to use farming systems approach to gather perceived and actual impacts of COVID-19 and warrants a more in-depth examination of agronomic and biophysical issues as well as the impact on the livelihoods and social well-being of families at community and household levels. Further examination will help identify the characteristics that strengthen smallholder farming systems resilience to adjust to anticipated and unanticipated shocks, such as COVID-19, to decrease the negative impacts and increase the rate of recovery.

However, existing knowledge about structural alterations in depression is equivocal and based on cohorts of limited sample size. This study used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and surface-based cortical thickness to investigate the structure of these circuits in a large and well-characterized patient cohort with MDD. Non-geriatric MDD outpatients (n\u00a0=\u00a0102) and age- and gender-matched healthy control participants (n\u00a0=\u00a034) provided T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data during their baseline visit as part of the International Study to Predict Optimized Treatment for Depression. Whole-brain VBM volumetric and surface-based cortical thickness assessments were performed voxel-wise and compared (at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 corrected for multiple comparisons) between the MDD and control groups. MDD participants had reduced gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex, regions of the prefrontal circuits, including dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices, and lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortices, but not in limbic regions. Additional reductions were observed cortically in the posterior temporal and parieto-occipital cortices and, subcortically in the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Focal cortical thinning in the medial orbitofrontal cortex was also observed for the MDD group. These alterations in volume and cortical thickness were not associated with severity of depressive symptoms. The findings demonstrate that widespread gray matter structural abnormalities are present in a well-powered study of patients with depression. The patterns of gray matter loss correspond to the same brain functional network regions that were previously established to be abnormal in MDD, which may support an underlying structural abnormality for these circuits. \u2022 Focal gray matter volume decrease in depression exceeded loss via aging 11\u201350\u00a0years. \u2022 Gray matter differences were found in regions with established roles in depression. \u2022 Structural change findings support the idea of depression as a network abnormality. \u2022 Hippocampal gray matter volume loss likely has no role in non-geriatric depression. \u2022 Amygdala gray matter volume loss likely plays no role in depression pathophysiology. Focal gray matter volume decrease in depression exceeded loss via aging 11\u201350\u00a0years. Gray matter differences were found in regions with established roles in depression.

        "abstract": "As Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has spread globally, hospital systems have seen an increasing strain on their ability to accommodate the growing caseload. This demand has led countries to adopt varying surge-facility or alternate care site (ACS) models to manage patient overflow. This report describes the experience of setting up pharmacy services at a city-run surge facility in Philadelphia. The COVID-19 Surge Facility at the Liacouras Center (CSF-L) was initially developed to serve as a site for patients convalescing from acute inpatient stays in order to free up healthcare resources in surrounding hospitals. The CSF-L site required a distinct set of services to provide the desired level of care. This report details the preparations and challenges faced by the CSF-L pharmacy team in this endeavor, including identifying a pharmacy location that met regulatory requirements, obtaining proper licenses, coordinating drug procurement, filling staffing requirements, developing a formulary, defining the pharmacy and medication management workflow, and ensuring safety protocols were followed. This report explains the rational for developing certain processes and suggests alternative options and ideal plans for developing future pharmacy services in an ACS. Identifying a pharmacy leadership team early in the ACS planning process can lead to more efficient plans for pharmacy services. This report details the important steps taken, decisions made, and challenges faced in setting up pharmaceutical services at a COVID-19 field hospital."

In this study, we used Citespace software to visually analyze 552 articles exploring the stem cell-based treatment of diabetic retinopathy over the past 20 years, which were included in the Web of Science Core Collection. We found the following: (1) a co-citation analysis of the references cited by all 552 articles indicated 15 clusters. In cluster #0, representing the stem cell field, some highly cited landmark studies emerged between 2009\u20132013. For example, endothelial progenitor cells and diabetic retinopathy gradually received the full attention of scholars, in terms of their relationship and therapeutic prospects. Some researchers also verified the potential of adipose-derived stem cells to differentiate into stable retinal perivascular cells, using a variety of animal models of retinal vascular disease. All of these achievements provided references for the subsequent stem cell research. (2) An analysis of popular keywords among the 552 articles revealed that, during the past 20 years, a relative increase in basic research articles examining stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy was observed. The contents of these articles primarily involved the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, vascular regeneration, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response. (3) A burst analysis of keywords used in the 552 articles indicated that genetic and cytological research regarding the promotion of angiogenesis was an issue of concern from 2001 to 2012, including several studies addressing the expression of various growth factor genes; from 2014 to 2020, mouse models of diabetic retinopathy were recognized as mature animal models, and the most recent research has focused on macular degeneration, macular edema, neurodegeneration, and inflammatory changes in diabetic animal models. (4) Globally, the current authoritative studies have focused on basic research towards the stem cell treatment of diabetic retinopathy. Existing clinical studies are of low quality and have insufficient evidence levels, and their findings have not yet been widely accepted in clinical practice. Major challenges during stem cell transplantation remain, including stem cell heterogeneity, cell delivery, and the effective homing of stem cells to damaged tissue. However, clinical trials examining potential stem cell-based treatments of diabetic retinopathy, including the use of pluripotent stem cells, retinal pigment epithelial cells, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, and endothelial progenitor cells, are currently ongoing, and high-quality clinical evidence is likely to appear in the future, to promote clinical transformation."

Pre-assessment was took in December 2019 and post (a year later) was performed in January 2021, during the lockdown induced by COVID-19 pandemic. Body mass (kg) was obtained using the digital scale. Handgrip strength (HGS) of the non-dominant hand was determined using an electronic dynamometer. Muscle function loss was assessed using the SARC-F questionnaire. After one year, body weight (p=0.002) and BMI (p=0.001) increased significantly, with an average percentage of change in body mass of +3.0\u00b15.2%. Consequently, there was a change in classification of BMI pre- and post-one year (malnutrition: 17.2% to 17.2%, normal weight: 41.4% to 37.9%, and overweight: 41.4% to 44.9%). Additionally, was found increased muscle function loss (SARC-F\u22654) of 13.8% to 27.6% of elderly women. In Brazilian physically active elderly women, we found that the physical inactivity imposed by during the lockdown increased the body mass and muscle function loss."

Preventive mastectomy is effective against both primary and contralateral breast cancer. Oophorectomy prevents ovarian cancer, and if done prior to menopause, will prevent breast cancer as well. Tamoxifen has been shown to prevent contralateral breast cancers in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers but is not widely accepted as a means of primary prevention. Oral contraceptives and tubal ligation will reduce the risk of hereditary ovarian cancer and should be considered in women who wish to retain ovarian function."

If dissociation is a product of trauma exposure, then dissociation would be a major mental health outcome observed in studies of disaster survivors. Although some studies have examined dissociation in disasters, no systematic literature reviews have been conducted to date on the topic. To systematically evaluate the literature on the association between disaster and dissociation to determine the prevalence and incidence of dissociation after exposure to disaster and further examine their relationship. EMBASE, Medline, and PsychINFO were searched from inception to January 1, 2019 to identify studies examining dissociative disorders or symptoms related to a disaster in adult or child disaster survivors and disaster responders. Studies of military conflicts and war, articles not in English, and those with samples of 30 or more participants were excluded. Search terms used were \u201cdisaster*\u201d and dissociation (\u201cdissociat*,\u201d \u201cmultiple personality,\u201d \u201cfugue,\u201d \u201cpsychogenic amnesia,\u201d \u201cderealization,\u201d and \u201cdepersonalization\u201d). Reference lists of identified articles were scrutinized to identify studies for additional articles. The final number of articles in the review was 53, including 36 articles with samples of adults aged 18 and above, 5 of children/adolescents under age 18, and 12 of disaster workers. Included articles studied several types of disasters that occurred between 1989 and 2017, more than one-third (38%) from the United States. Only two studies had a primary aim to investigate dissociation in relation to disaster and none reported data on dissociative disorders. All of the studies used self-report symptom scales; none used structured interviews providing full diagnostic assessment of dissociative disorders or other psychopathology. Several studies mixed exposed and unexposed samples or did not differentiate outcomes between exposure groups. Studies examining associations between dissociation and disaster exposure have been inconclusive. The majority (75%) of the studies compared dissociation with posttraumatic stress, with inconsistent findings. Dissociation was found to be associated with a wide range of other psychiatric disorders, symptoms, and negative emotional, cognitive, and functional states. The studies reviewed had serious methodological limitations including problems with measurement of psychopathology, sampling, and generation of unwarranted conclusions, precluding conclusions that dissociation is an established outcome of disaster."

To elucidate the contact sensitivity to food additives in children suffering from AD by using standardized atopy patch testing. A total of 45 children with AD and 20 healthy children have been enrolled. All the children have regularly consumed food containing additives, and were subjected to atopy patch tests. In total, 28 (62%) children with AD and 4 (20%) healthy children have had positive patch test reactions to \u2265 1 allergens. There has been a significant difference ( p = 0.04) between the groups in terms of the positivity rate in the patch test and the most common allergen that elicited positive patch test results in the AD group was azorubine ( n = 11, 24.4%, p = 0.014). In our study, contact sensitivity was detected more frequently in AD patients. Food additives may play a role in the development and exacerbation of AD. Atopy patch testing with food additives can be useful in the treatment and follow-up of children with AD."

To clarify the toxicokinetics, and residues of ZEA and its major metabolites \u03b1-zearalenol (\u03b1-ZOL) and \u03b2-zearalenol (\u03b2-ZOL) in chickens, ZEA was then administered intravenously (iv) or orally (po) to broiler chickens at a dosage of 1.2\u00a0mg/kg body weight. The concentrations of ZEA, \u03b1-ZOL and \u03b2-ZOL in the plasma and various tissues were quantified using LC\u2013MS/MS. The plasma concentrations of ZEA were measurable up to 2\u00a0h after iv and po administration, and the concentrations of \u03b1-ZOL and \u03b2-ZOL were detected up to 4\u00a0h after both types of administration. A two-compartment model was developed to describe the toxicokinetic of ZEA in broilers. The values of t 1/2\u03b2 and V d were 1.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.29\u00a0h and 6.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.89\u00a0l/kg, respectively. The absolute oral bioavailability was 29.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.6%. ZEA, \u03b1-ZOL and \u03b2-ZOL were measurable in the vital organs after po administration. These results suggest that ZEA is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and it has ability to penetrate into the various tissues of broiler chickens."

        "abstract": "Orthostatic tremor (OT) remains among the most intriguing and poorly understood of movement disorders. Compared to Parkinson\u2019s disease or even essential tremor, there are very few articles addressing more basic science issues. In this review, we will discuss the findings of main case series on OT, including data on etiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic approach, treatment strategies, and outcome. Data for this review were identified by searching PUBMED (January 1966 to August 2016) for the terms \u201corthostatic tremor\u201d or \u201cshaky leg syndrome,\u201d which yielded 219 entries. We did not exclude papers on the basis of language, country, or publication date. The electronic database searches were supplemented by articles in the authors\u2019 files that pertained to this topic. Owing to its rarity, the current understanding of OT is limited and is mostly based on small case series or case reports. Despite this, a growing body of evidence indicates that OT might be a progressive condition that is clinically heterogeneous (primary vs. secondary cases) with a broader spectrum of clinical features, mainly cerebellar signs, and possible cognitive impairment and personality disturbances. Along with this, advanced neuroimaging techniques are now demonstrating distinct anatomical and functional changes, some of which are consistent with neuronal loss. OT might be a family of diseases, unified by the presence of leg tremor, but further characterized by etiological and clinical heterogeneity. More work is needed to understand the pathogenesis of this condition."

        "abstract": "Basal-like breast cancer is an aggressive form of breast cancer with limited treatment options. The subgroup can be identified immunohistochemically, by lack of hormone receptor expression combined with expression of basal markers such as CK5/6 and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In vitro, several regulators of the actin cytoskeleton are essential for efficient invasion of basal-like breast cancer cell lines. Whether these proteins are expressed in vivo determines the applicability of these findings in clinical settings. The actin-regulating formin protein FHOD1 participates in invasion of the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Here, we measure the expression of FHOD1 protein in clinical triple-negative breast cancers by using immunohistochemistry and further characterize the expression of another formin protein, INF2. We report that basal-like breast cancers frequently overexpress formin proteins FHOD1 and INF2. In cell studies using basal-like breast cancer cell lines, we show that knockdown of FHOD1 or INF2 interferes with very similar processes: maintenance of cell shape, migration, invasion, and proliferation. Inhibition of EGFR, PI3K, or mitogen-activated protein kinase activity does not alter the expression of FHOD1 and INF2 in these cell lines. We conclude that the experimental studies on these formins have implications in the clinical behavior of basal-like breast cancer."

Few information on clinical features and immunological profile of COVID-19 in paediatrics. The clinical features and treatment outcomes of twelve paediatric patients confirmed as COVID-19 were analyzed. The immunological features of children patients was investigated and compared with twenty adult patients. The median age was 14.5-years (range from 0.64 to 17), and six of the patients were male. The average incubation period was 8 days. Clinically, cough (9/12, 75%) and fever (7/12, 58.3%) were the most common symptoms. Four patients (33.3%) had diarrhea during the disease. As to the immune profile, children had higher amount of total T cell, CD8+ T cell and B cell but lower CRP levels than adults ( P <\u00a00.05). Ground-glass opacity (GGO) and local patchy shadowing were the typical radiological findings on chest CT scan. All patients received antiviral and symptomatic treatment and the symptom relieved in 3\u20134 days after admitted to hospital. The paediatric patients showed mild symptom but with longer incubation period. Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 had different immune profile with higher T cell amount and low inflammatory factors level, which might ascribed to the mild clinical symptom. We advise that nucleic acid test or examination of serum IgM/IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 should be taken for children with exposure history regardless of clinical symptom."

This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to assess the effectiveness of lipid screening in children and adolescents according to the existence of positive FH of CVD risk factors. PubMed, Scopus, and Google scholar were searched to identify relevant papers that were published from November 1980 until 30 November 2013. Irrelevant studies were set aside after studying their title, abstract, and full text. Then, the relevant studies were assessed by using a quality appraisal checklist. We used random effect model for meta-analysis and calculating the total estimation of sensitivity, specificity, and the positive predictive value (PPV) of FH in predicting dyslipidemia among children and adolescents. Overall, 17,214 studies were identified in the primary search, out of which 19 primary studies were qualified for study entry. The sensitivity of positive FH of premature CVD or dyslipidemia for predicting dyslipidemia among children varied between 15 and 93. Moreover, the effectiveness of screening children for dyslipidemia according to premature CVD or dyslipidemia in their relatives was low in 86.9% of the primary studies. The total estimation of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value was 42.6, 59, and 20.7, respectively, according to the meta-analysis results. The present meta-analysis indicated that selecting target population for screening children and adolescents for dyslipidemia according to their FH has low sensitivity."

There is a limited number of clinical studies investigating the effects of beta-blockers on GGT and uric acid levels in these patients. In our study, we aimed to investigate the effects of beta-blocker therapy on GGT and uric acid levels. We conducted a randomized, prospective clinical study. Hundred patients with NSTEMI were included in this study, and they were divided into two groups. Fifty patients were administered metoprolol succinate treatment (1 \u00d7 50 mg), whereas the remaining 50 patients were administered carvedilol treatment (2 \u00d7 12.5 mg). Thereafter, all of the patients underwent coronary angiography. Blood samples were taken at the time of admission, at the 1 st month, and 3 rd month to detect GGT and uric acid levels. There was no statistically significant difference among the metoprolol or carvedilol groups in terms of the GGT levels measured at the baseline, 1 st month, and 3 rd month (p=0.904 and p=0.573, respectively). In addition, there was no statistically significant difference among the metoprolol or carvedilol groups in terms of uric acid levels measured at the baseline, 1 st month, and 3 rd month (p=0.601 and p=0.601, respectively). We found that GGT and uric acid levels did not show any change compared to the baseline values, with metoprolol and carvedilol treatment initiated in the early period in patients with NSTEMI."

To identify factors and their relative contributions to smoking cessation among male prisoners. A total of 425 male tobacco smokers with a median age of 32 years in Australian prisons. The primary outcome was continuous abstinence at 3, 6 and 12 months. We measured various sociodemographic characteristics, drug use, psychological distress and the mental and physical health status of the participants. Multivariate logistic regression models and population attributable risks (PAR%) were used to identify the significant factors and their contributions to smoking cessation rates. The median age of participants was 32 years (IQR 25\u201341 years). High smoking cessation rates were collectively associated with not using drugs, lower psychological distress, good mental health scores and better physical health (PAR%: 93%, 98% and 88% at 3, 6 and 12 months). Our study suggests that not using drugs and being in good mental/physical health are the important contributors to continuous abstinence among prisoners. Thus, effective smoking cessation programmes require a multicomponent approach that includes addressing drug problems and mental health functioning. 12606000229572."

Using these samples, RT-PCR and ELISA analysis were carried out for the comparative study of the cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, INF-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-12. In the Pohang-infected mice at 120 h, the liver showed a 53 times higher level of TNF-\u03b1 and a 42 times higher level of IFN-\u03b3 than the respective levels at the early time points after infection. The levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 induced by LVS were 5 times lower than those induced by the Pohang isolate. Also, the organs from the Pohang-infected mice showed higher levels of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-10 and IL-12 than the levels in the LVS-infected mice. The blood from the Pohang-infected mice at 120 h revealed about a 40 times increased level of IFN-\u03b3, and IL-10 was also increased by 4 times at 96 h compared to an early infection time point, while IL-4 was not induced during the whole infection period. These results suggest that F. tularensis may induce a Th1-mediated immune response to in vivo infection and the Pohang isolate has a higher capacity than the LVS to induce an acute immune response in Blab/c mice."

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is multifocal, characterized by distinct disabilities affecting walking, vision, cognition, and fatigue. Neuroprotective treatments tailored for each disability may be more effective than nonspecific treatments aiming to reduce a composite of disabilities in clinical trials. Here, we use the MS model to apply a cell-specific and region-specific gene expression approach to discover targets in distinct neuroanatomic regions. Altered cholesterol synthesis gene expression in astrocytes in spinal cord and optic nerve was identified as a potential target for walking and visual disabilities, respectively. This disability-specific discovery approach represents a strategy for finding neuroprotective treatments for multifocal neurodegenerative diseases. Changes in gene expression that occur across the central nervous system (CNS) during neurological diseases do not address the heterogeneity of cell types from one CNS region to another and are complicated by alterations in cellular composition during disease. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is multifocal by definition. Here, a cell-specific and region-specific transcriptomics approach was used to determine gene expression changes in astrocytes in the most widely used MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Astrocyte-specific RNAs from various neuroanatomic regions were attained using RiboTag technology. Sequencing and bioinformatics analyses showed that EAE-induced gene expression changes differed between neuroanatomic regions when comparing astrocytes from spinal cord, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus. The top gene pathways that were changed in astrocytes from spinal cord during chronic EAE involved decreases in expression of cholesterol synthesis genes while immune pathway gene expression in astrocytes was increased. Optic nerve from EAE and optic chiasm from MS also showed decreased cholesterol synthesis gene expression. The potential role of cholesterol synthesized by astrocytes during EAE and MS is discussed. Together, this provides proof-of-concept that a cell-specific and region-specific gene expression approach can provide potential treatment targets in distinct neuroanatomic regions during multifocal neurological diseases."

Online questionnaires were answered from 26 March to 3 April 2020 in the Netherlands by 340 smokers willing to quit smoking. Beliefs regarding (quitting) smoking and (consequences of) the coronavirus are described and associations with motivation to quit due to the coronavirus are reported. While 67.7% of the smokers indicated that the coronavirus did not influence the number of cigarettes smoked per day, 18.5% smoked less cigarettes and 13.8% smoked more cigarettes per day due to the coronavirus. One-third of the smokers were more motivated to quit smoking due to the coronavirus. Motivation to quit due to the coronavirus was positively associated with beliefs about the coronavirus as a serious threat, being at high risk of catching the coronavirus and developing severe illness, smokers being at higher risk than non-smokers, quitting smoking to reduce complaints, the social environment endorsing quitting, and perceived stress. Subgroups of smokers may be receptive to smoking cessation advice due to COVID-19. Because of the measures taken to reduce the spread of the virus (e.g. stay at home as much as possible), personalized digital health interventions may be particularly suitable to reach smokers at home."

A total number of 157 S. aureus strains were investigated. Sixty-two strains were isolated from Swedish adults with oral infections, 25 strains were from saliva of healthy Swedish dental students, and 45 strains were from tongue scrapings of HIV-positive subjects in Thailand, and 25 Thai strains from non-HIV controls. The isolates were tested for coagulase, nitrate, arginine, and hemolysin, and for the presence of the virulence genes: hlg , clfA , can , sdrC , sdrD , sdrE , map/eap (adhesins) and sea , seb , sec , tst , eta , etb , pvl (toxins). MIC 90 and MIC 50 were determined by E-test against penicillin V, oxacillin, amoxicillin, clindamycin, vancomycin, fusidic acid, and cefoxitin. While the hemolytic phenotype was significantly ( p <0.001) more common among the Thai strains compared to Swedish strains, the virulence genes were found in a similar frequency in the S. aureus strains isolated from all four subject groups. The Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genotype was found in 73\u2013100% of the strains. More than 10% of the strains from Swedish oral infections and from Thai HIV-positives showed low antibiotic susceptibility, most commonly for clindamycin. Only three methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains were identified, two from oral infections and one from a Thai HIV patient.  S. aureus is occasionally occurring in the oral cavity in both health and disease in Sweden and Thailand. It is therefore most likely that S. aureus in opportunistic oral infections originate from the oral microbiota. S. aureus should be considered in case of oral infections and complaints and the antibiotic susceptibility (including MRSA) should regularly be checked. The frequent presence of S. aureus , although in low numbers among students and staff, emphasizes the importance of standard infection control precautions and of using diagnostic test in the dental clinic."

This network meta\u2010analysis suggested that SET and ER+SET are effective at improving MWD over the moderate term (<2\u00a0year) but not beyond this.

In neuronal diseases such as multiple sclerosis, the conduction properties of axons are disturbed by the removal of the myelin sheath, leaving nerve cells at a higher risk of degenerating. In some cases, the protective myelin sheath of axons can be rebuilt by remyelination through oligodendroglial cells. In any case, however, changes in the ion channel organization occur and may help to restore impulse conduction after demyelination. On the other hand, changes in ion channel distribution may increase the energy demand of axons, thereby increasing the probability of axonal degeneration. Many attempts have been made or discussed in recent years to increase remyelination of affected axons in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. These approaches range from pharmacological treatments that reduce inflammatory processes or block ion channels to the modulation of neuronal activity through electrical cortical stimulation. However, these treatments either affect the entire organism (pharmacological) or exert a very local effect (electrodes). Current results show that neuronal activity is a strong regulator of oligodendroglial development. To bridge the gap between global and very local treatments, non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation could be considered. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is externally applied to brain areas and experiments with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation show that the neuronal activity can be modulated depending on the stimulation parameters in both humans and animals. In this review, we discuss the possibilities of influencing ion channel distribution and increasing neuronal activity by transcranial magnetic stimulation as well as the effect of this modulation on oligodendroglial cells and their capacity to remyelinate previously demyelinated axons. Although the physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation clearly need further investigations, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may be a promising approach for non-invasive neuronal modulation aiming at enhancing remyelination and thus reducing neurodegeneration."

        "abstract": "Direct pharmacological targeting of the anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family is an attractive therapeutic strategy for treating cancer. Obatoclax is a pan-BCL-2 family inhibitor currently in clinical development. Here we show that, although obatoclax can induce mitochondrial apoptosis dependent on BCL-2 associated x protein/BCL-2 antagonist killer (BAX/BAK) consistent with its on-target pharmacodynamics, simultaneous silencing of both BAX and BAK did not abolish acute toxicity or loss of clonogenicity. This is despite complete inhibition of apoptosis. Obatoclax dramatically reduced viability without inducing loss of plasma membrane integrity. This was associated with rapid processing of light chain-3 (LC3) and reduction of S6 kinase phosphorylation, consistent with autophagy. Dramatic ultrastructural vacuolation, not typical of autophagy, was also induced. Silencing of beclin-1 failed to prevent LC3 processing, whereas knockout of autophagy-related (Atg)7 abolished LC3 processing but failed to prevent obatoclax-induced loss of clonogenicity or ultrastructural changes. siRNA silencing of Atg7 in BAX/BAK knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts did not prevent obatoclax-induced loss of viability. Cells selected for obatoclax resistance evaded apoptosis independent of changes in BCL-2 family expression and displayed reduced LC3 processing. In summary, obatoclax exhibits BAX- and BAK-dependent and -independent mechanisms of toxicity and activation of autophagy. Mechanisms other than autophagy and apoptosis are blocked in obatoclax resistant cells and contribute significantly to obatoclax's anticancer efficacy."

The present research study was set out to investigate the role of coping strategies and social support as moderating factors of the relationship between occupational stress and mental health in police personnel of Uttar Pradesh in terms of their ranking. The present cross-sectional study was conducted using standardized questionnaires. The sample comprised a total of 300 male police personnel. Hundred constables, 100 inspectors, and 100 officers were incidentally selected from six districts of Uttar: Lucknow, Varanasi, Meerut, Raebareli, Ghaziabad, and Noida. Study results showed coping strategies and social support to have a moderating effect on the relationship between stress and mental health in inspectors and officers but failed to show such relationship in constables. There is the implication for the training in terms of teaching-specific active and adaptive coping strategies for the management of workplace-related stress and promotion of health and well-being in the police personnel."

        "abstract": "In this article, we begin by discussing approximately thirty picture books dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic published digitally in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other English-speaking countries in the first six months of 2020. The worldwide impact of COVID-19 resulted in the rapid global digital publication of numerous English-language children\u2019s picture books aimed at informing child readers about public health concerns and how children could contribute to improving health outcomes. This exploration of contemporary picture books is intertwined with examinations of two other public health crises that appeared in literature for children: the discussion of British children\u2019s health in the Junior Red Cross Magazine in the 1920s and the American polio outbreak discussed in educational materials and fiction in the 1940s and 1950s. These comparisons not only enable us to situate the COVID-19 pandemic within a history of transnational responses to concerns about children\u2019s health but also to expand our understanding of how children are positioned to take individual responsibility for community public health issues. This wide range of Anglophone texts published in the United Kingdom, the United States, and around the world demonstrates the extent to which adults attempt to guide children towards specific behaviours to promote individual health. They also reflect a common understanding of childhood in which children have an obligation to contribute to societal wellbeing through their individual actions."

The miRNA microarray dataset GSE32957 contained miRNA expression data from 16 ICC, 7 mixed type of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (CHC), 2 hepatic adenoma, 3 focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and 5 healthy liver tissue samples, and 2 cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. In addition, the mRNA microarray dataset GSE32879 contained mRNA expression data from 16 ICC, 7 CHC, 2 hepatic adenoma, 5 FNH and 7 healthy liver tissue samples. The datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMs) in ICC samples compared with healthy liver tissues were identified via the limma package, following data preprocessing. Genes that exhibited alternative splicing (AS) in ICC samples were identified via AltAnalyze software. Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Analysis. Target genes of DEMs were identified using the TargetScan database. The regulatory association between DEMs and any overlaps among DEGs, alternative splicing genes (ASGs) and target genes of DEMs were retrieved, and a network was visualized using the Cytoscape software. A total of 2,327 DEGs, 70 DEMs and 623 ASGs were obtained. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that DEGs were primarily enriched in biological processes and pathways associated with cell activity or the immune system. A total of 63 overlaps were obtained among DEGs, ASGs and target genes of DEMs, and a regulation network that contained 243 miRNA-gene regulation pairs was constructed between these overlaps and DEMs. The overlapped genes, including sprouty-related EVH1 domain containing 1, protein phosphate 1 regulatory subunit 12A, chromosome 20 open reading frame 194, and DEMs, including hsa-miR-96, hsa-miR-1 and hsa-miR-25 , may be potential therapeutic targets for the future treatment of ICC."

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus saw the beginning of an extensive global collaboration and has influenced many outbreak preparedness protocols now in place. Avian influenza is a particular threat, with cases of A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) reported most recently. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus is causing continuing concerns with outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula. Healthcare facilities worldwide play a crucial role in identifying threats and must be vigilant. Particularly important is identifying and managing emerging respiratory viruses when they are infrequently encountered.

        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide with increasing incidence and mortality in developed countries. Oncogenes and microRNAs regulate key signaling pathways in CRC and are known to be deregulated. Oncogenic transcriptional regulator high-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) participates in the transformation of several cancers including CRC and exhibits strong correlation with poor prognosis and distal metastasis. Evidence of HMGA2 and its co-regulated miRs contributing to tumor progression remains to be clarified. Methods: We performed gene-set enrichment analysis on the expression profiles of 70 CRC patients and revealed HMGA2 correlated genes that are targeted by several miRs including miR-194. To eliminate the oncogenic effects in HMGA2-driven CRC, we re-expressed miR-194 and found that miR-194 functions as a tumor suppressor by reducing cell proliferation and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo . Results: As a direct upstream inhibitory regulator of miR-194, overexpression of HMGA2 reduced miR-194 expression and biological activity, whereas re-expressing miR-194 in cells with high levels of HMGA2 impaired the effects of HMGA2, compromising cell survival, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process, and drug resistance. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that novel molecular correlations can be discovered by revisiting transcriptome profiles. We uncover that miR-194 is as important as HMGA2, and both coordinately regulate the oncogenesis of CRC with inverted behaviors, revealing alternative molecular therapeutics for CRC patients with high HMGA2 expression."

Of 964 poultry workers, 9 (0.93%) were seropositive for subtype H7N9 virus, 18 (1.87%) for H9N2, and 18 (1.87%) for H5N1.

Longitudinal surveillance of AIVs at 9 LPMs revealed high co-circulation of H9, H7, and H5 subtypes. We detected AIVs in 726 (23.3%) of 3,121 samples and identified a high diversity (10 subtypes) of new genetic constellations and reassortant viruses.

Few studies have compared clinical outcomes after catheter ablation between patients with and those without DM. The purpose of this study was to compare AF ablation outcomes in patients with and those without DM. We performed a retrospective analysis of 351 consecutive patients who underwent first-time AF ablation. Clinical outcomes included freedom from recurrent atrial arrhythmia, symptom burden (Mayo AF Symptom Inventory score), cardiovascular and all-cause hospitalizations, and periprocedural complications. Patients with DM (n = 65) were older, had a higher body mass index, more persistent AF, more hypertension, and larger left atrial diameter ( P <.05 for all). Median (Q1, Q3) total radiofrequency duration [64.0 (43.6, 81.4) minutes vs 54.3 (39.2, 76.4) minutes; P = .132] and periprocedural complications ( P = .868) did not differ between patients with and those without DM. After a median follow-up of 29.5 months, arrhythmia recurrence was significantly higher in the DM group compared to the no-DM group after adjustment for baseline differences (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.24; 95% confidence [CI] 1.42\u20133.55; P = .001). There was a nonsignificant trend toward higher AF recurrence with worse glycemic levels (HR 1.29; 95% CI 0.99\u20131.69; P = .064). Although safety outcomes associated with AF ablation were similar between patients with and those without DM, arrhythmia-free survival was significantly lower among patients with DM.

        "abstract": "This post hoc analysis evaluated the efficacy of galcanezumab for the prevention of migraine in patients with and without comorbid anxiety and/or depression. Patients with migraine have a higher risk of anxiety and/or depression. Given the high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and their potential negative prognostic impact, determining the efficacy of migraine treatments in patients with these comorbidities is important. The results of 2 phase 3 episodic migraine studies of patients with 4\u201014 migraine headache days (MHD) per month were pooled. A third chronic migraine study, which was evaluated separately, enrolled patients with \u226515 headache days per month, of which \u22658 had migraine\u2010like features. Patients in all 3 studies were randomized 2:1:1 to placebo, galcanezumab 120\u00a0mg, or galcanezumab 240\u00a0mg. The efficacy of galcanezumab on migraine was measured in subgroups of patients with anxiety and/or depression (current or past) and patients without. A repeated measures model was used to compare treatment groups within each subgroup and to test for consistency of treatment effect across the anxiety/depression subgroups (subgroup\u2010by\u2010treatment interaction) during the double\u2010blind treatment phases. Among 1773 intent\u2010to\u2010treat patients with episodic migraine, both doses of galcanezumab demonstrated statistically significant improvements relative to placebo in overall number of MHD for the subgroups of patients with anxiety and/or depression (mean change difference from placebo [95% CI]: \u22122.07 [\u22122.81, \u22121.33] for galcanezumab 120\u00a0mg [ P <\u00a0.001], \u22121.91 [\u22122.78, \u22121.04] for 240\u00a0mg [ P <\u00a0.001]) and without anxiety and/or depression (mean change difference from placebo [95% CI]: \u22121.92 [\u22122.36, \u22121.47] for 120\u00a0mg [ P <\u00a0.001], \u22121.77 [\u22122.20, \u22121.33] for 240\u00a0mg [ P <\u00a0.001]), as was observed for the secondary outcomes of MHD with acute medication use and functional impairment. Among 1113 intent\u2010to\u2010treat patients with chronic migraine, those with anxiety and/or depression had significant reductions in overall MHD frequency with the 240\u2010mg dose (mean change difference from placebo [95% CI]: \u22121.92 [\u22123.52, \u22120.33]; P =\u00a0.018), whereas significant reductions were observed at both the 120\u2010mg (mean change difference from placebo [95% CI]: \u22122.29 [\u22123.26, \u22121.31]; P <\u00a0.001) and 240\u2010mg (\u22121.85 [\u22122.83, \u22120.87]; P <\u00a0.001) doses in patients without anxiety and/or depressions. Significant reductions ( P <\u00a0.01) in MHD with acute medication use were observed at both doses within both anxiety/depression subgroups and for overall functional impairment for patients without anxiety and/or depression, though neither dose significantly reduced overall functional impairment beyond placebo in the subgroup with anxiety and/or depression. In the episodic and chronic migraine studies, the subgroup\u2010by\u2010treatment interaction was not statistically significant for MHD, MHD with acute medication use, or functional impairment (chronic study only), suggesting a lack of evidence of differential effect between subgroups. Furthermore, differences between subgroups in the mean change differences from placebo, as well as overlapping 95% confidence intervals for the subgroups, indicated lack of a clinical or statistical difference between subgroups for these outcome variables. There was a significantly higher percentage of patients with episodic migraine attaining \u226550%, \u226575%, and 100% reductions, and a higher percentage of patients with chronic migraine attaining \u226550% and \u226575% reductions from baseline with galcanezumab compared with placebo, regardless of medical history of anxiety and/or depression. A medical history of anxiety and/or depression does not seem to interfere with response to galcanezumab among patients with episodic migraine, and both doses of galcanezumab appear efficacious for these individuals regardless of this psychiatric history. Among patients with chronic migraine and comorbid anxiety and/or depression, the 240\u2010mg dose, but not the 120\u2010mg dose, significantly decreased overall MHD, but neither dose resulted in significantly greater functional improvement. Patients with migraine and comorbid anxiety and/or depression often require additional interventions, and this may be more important in chronic migraine."

Production of therapeutic proteins in plants has now a more pragmatic approach when several plant-produced vaccines and antibodies successfully completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and were further scheduled for regulatory approvals to manufacture clinical grade products on a large scale which are safe, efficacious, and meet the quality standards. The main thrust of this review is to summarize the data accumulated over the last two decades and recent development and achievements of the plant derived therapeutics. It also attempts to discuss different strategies employed to increase the production so as to make plants more competitive with the established production systems in this industry."

Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, so far no computational methods whatsoever could be used to deal with the\u00a0second problem, let\u00a0alone deal with the two problems together. Here, by incorporating the physicochemical properties of nucleotides into the pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition (PseKNC), we proposed a powerful predictor called 2L-piRNA. It is a two-layer ensemble classifier, in which the first layer is for identifying whether a query RNA molecule is piRNA or non-piRNA, and the second layer for identifying whether a piRNA is with or without the function of instructing target mRNA deadenylation. Rigorous cross-validations have indicated that the success rates achieved by the proposed predictor are quite high. For the convenience of most biologists and drug development scientists, the web\u00a0server for 2L-piRNA has been established at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/2L-piRNA/ , by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to go through the mathematical details."

Fifty cast commercially pure titanium discs (9 mm \u00d7 2 mm) were divided into five groups ( n = 10), which received the following surface treatments: Control group (no surface treatment), group 1 (grit blasting using 110 \u00b5m Al 2 O 3 particles and application of alloy primer), group 2 (grit blasting using 110 \u00b5m Al 2 O 3 particles and chemical treatment using 1N HCl), group 3 (chemical treatment using 1N HCl and application of alloy primer), and group 4 (Grit blasting using 110 \u00b5m Al 2 O 3 particles, chemical treatment using 1N HCl and application of alloy primer). Superbond C and B resin cement was applied to the treated titanium surfaces including controls. SBSs were determined after thermocycling for 5000 cycles. Data (megapascal) were analyzed by ANOVA and Bonferroni test. Group 4 (grit blasting using 110 \u00b5m Al 2 O 3 particles, chemical treatment using 1N hydrochloric acid, and application of alloy primer) produced the highest bond strength followed by group 1, group 3, group 2, and the control group which showed the least bond strength. (1) Air-abrasion with alumina particles increases the micromechanical retention of the resin to titanium. (2) The alloy primer promotes wettability, which increases the adhesive bonding of resin cement to titanium. (3) Chemical treatment using hydrochloric acid effectively pretreats the titanium surface thereby increasing the SBS values."

The protocol consisted of 3 phases (Familiarization, Adaptation, and Wash Out) repeated one time for each movement direction (plantarflexion, dorsiflexion, inversion, and eversion). During Familiarization and Wash out subjects performed goal-directed movements in unperturbed environment, whereas during Adaptation phase, a curl viscous force field was applied and it was randomly removed 10 times out of 200. Ankle motor performance was evaluated by means of a set of indices grouped into: accuracy, smoothness, temporal, and stopping indices. Learning Index was calculated to study the motor learning during the adaptation phase, which was subdivided into 5 temporal intervals (target sets). The outcomes related to the ankle motor performance highlighted that the best performance in terms of accuracy and smoothness of the trajectories was obtained in dorsiflexion movements in the sagittal plane, and in inversion rotations in the frontal plane. Differences between movement directions revealed an anisotropic behavior of the ankle joint. Results of the Learning index showed a capability of the subjects to rapidly adapt to a perturbed force field depending on the magnitude of the perceived field.

        "abstract": "Interoception, the perception of our body internal signals, plays a key role in maintaining homeostasis and guiding our behavior. Sometimes, we become aware of our body signals and use them in planning and strategic thinking. Here, we show behavioral and neural dissociations between learning to follow one's own heartbeat and metacognitive awareness of one's performance, in a heartbeat-tapping task performed before and after auditory feedback. The electroencephalography amplitude of the heartbeat-evoked potential in interoceptive learners, that is, participants whose accuracy of tapping to their heartbeat improved after auditory feedback, was higher compared with non-learners. However, an increase in gamma phase synchrony (30\u201345 Hz) after the heartbeat auditory feedback was present only in those participants showing agreement between objective interoceptive performance and metacognitive awareness. Source localization in a group of participants and direct cortical recordings in a single patient identified a network hub for interoceptive learning in the insular cortex. In summary, interoceptive learning may be mediated by the right insular response to the heartbeat, whereas metacognitive awareness of learning may be mediated by widespread cortical synchronization patterns."

Dexmedetomidine (Dex) is a highly selective \u03b1 2 adrenergic receptor agonist used as additive to increase quality and duration of peripheral nerve blocks. The current study aimed to compare the effect of dexmedetomidine and fentanyl additives on bupivacaine to prolong the duration of block and minimizing side effects. Patients were candidates for elective surgery less than three hours of lower abdomen or lower extremities surgeries. Patients were randomly allocated to receive dexmedetomidine 5 \u00b5g added to 12.5 mg (2.5 mL) of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine (DEX group), or 25 \u00b5g (0.5 mL) fentanyl added to 12.5 mg (2.5 mL) of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine (F group) or only 12.5 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine. Data were recorded based on sensory block. Motor block was tested using modified Bromage scale every 30 minutes until the end of block. Time to return of sensory block to 4 dermatomes below and time to return of Bromage scale to 0 were recorded. All vital measurements (oxygen saturation, heart rate, electrocardiogram, and non-invasive blood pressure) were performed at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes in all three groups of the study. Group DEX received dexmedetomidine additive and group F received fentanyl additive and group C (control) received normal saline. Totally, 84 patients were randomly divided into three groups of 28 patients. Onset of sensory block in DEX group was significantly lower than those of fentanyl (P = 0.012) and control groups (P = 0.001). Duration of sensory block was significantly longer in DEX group compared to Fentanyl (P = 0.043) and control (P = 0.016) groups. Duration of motor block in the DEX group was significantly longer than those of the fentanyl (P = 0.014) and control groups. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were significantly higher in the DEX group at 30, 60, 90,120, and 180 minutes compared to those of the other two groups (P < 0.05). Dexmedetomidine added to bupivacaine in spinal anesthesia is more effective to increase duration of block, providing more appropriate sedation and less postoperative pain scale and post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) compared to fentanyl additive."

Osteosarcoma patients ( n =158) and controls with benign orthopaedic conditions ( n =141) under age 40 were recruited from US orthopaedic surgery departments. Exposures were ascertained by interview, birth, and growth records. Age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Current height and age- and sex-specific height percentiles were not associated with osteosarcoma risk. Male cases, however, appeared to have an earlier adolescent growth period, and earlier attainment of final height (OR=7.1; 95% CI=1.6\u201350 for <19 vs 19+ years), whereas earlier puberty appeared protective with ORs of 0.41 (95% CI 0.18\u20130.89) and 0.68 (95% CI 0.31\u20131.5) for developing facial and pubic hair, respectively.

These data provide some evidence that osteosarcoma is related to size at birth and in early adolescence, while earlier puberty in male subjects may be protective."

However, the underlying pathomechanisms involved still need to be clarified. Here, we report that an obesity-associated increase in serum leptin triggers the select expansion of the micro-angioarchitecture in pre-autonomic brain centers that regulate hemodynamic homeostasis. By using a series of cell- and region-specific loss- and gain-of-function models, we show that this pathophysiological process depends on hypothalamic astroglial hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1-vascular endothelial growth factor (HIF1\u03b1-VEGF) signaling downstream of leptin signaling. Importantly, several distinct models of HIF1\u03b1-VEGF pathway disruption in astrocytes are protected not only from obesity-induced hypothalamic angiopathy but also from sympathetic hyperactivity or arterial hypertension. These results suggest that hyperleptinemia promotes obesity-induced hypertension via a HIF1\u03b1-VEGF signaling cascade in hypothalamic astrocytes while establishing a novel mechanistic link that connects hypothalamic micro-angioarchitecture with control over systemic blood pressure. \u2022 The hypothalamic gliovascular interface is dynamically remodeled during obesity \u2022 Circulating leptin couples hypercaloric states with hypothalamic microangiopathy \u2022 Leptin-induced astroglial HIF1\u03b1-VEGF drives angiogenesis in the hypothalamus \u2022 VEGF in astrocytes promotes the development of arterial hypertension during obesity The hypothalamic gliovascular interface is dynamically remodeled during obesity Circulating leptin couples hypercaloric states with hypothalamic microangiopathy Leptin-induced astroglial HIF1\u03b1-VEGF drives angiogenesis in the hypothalamus VEGF in astrocytes promotes the development of arterial hypertension during obesity Here, Gruber et\u00a0al. show that during diet-induced obesity in mice there is a profound remodeling of the gliovascular interface in the hypothalamus, resulting in arterial hypertension.

Of 1090 patients undergoing fractional flow reserve (FFR) assessment from 2002 to 2009, we identified 167 patients in whom FFR was measured in at least one 70%\u201389% stenotic lesion. These patients were subdivided into an FFR-defer group ( n = 49) if PCI was deferred (FFR > 0.80), and an FFR-perform group ( n = 118) if PCI was performed (FFR \u2264 0.80). Comparatively, an additional 1176 patients undergoing PCI in at least one lesion with 70%\u201389% stenosis but without measurement of FFR served as a control (angiography-guided) group. Clinical outcomes were compared during a median follow-up of 49.0 months. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimated revascularization rates were 16% in the FFR-defer group and 33% in the FFR-perform group ( P = 0.046). The incidence of major adverse cardiac events were comparable in these two groups (HR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.37\u20131.82, P = 0.63). The number of stents placed was significantly lower in the FFR-guided group (0.9 \u00b1 0.8 vs. 1.4 \u00b1 0.8, P < 0.001). Functional revascularization for lesions with visually severe stenosis is clinically safe and associated with fewer stents use. This study suggests that extending the use of FFR to more severe coronary lesions may be reasonable."

Most patients are reluctant for extra donor-site scars besides infections and necrosis. In order to reduce these risks, a two-stage breast reconstruction technique is used for high-risk women with large or ptotic breasts. We presume that this procedure will reduce the risk of skin envelope and nipple\u2013areola complex (NAC) necrosis to less than 1%. In the first stage, an inferior pedicle reduction is performed to obtain large volume reduction with maximal safety for the NAC. The ptosis, skin excess, and malpositioning of the NAC are corrected safely at this stage. In the second stage, the skin-sparing mastectomy is performed with or without nipple sparing. During this procedure, the areola is never removed. A bilateral breast reconstruction is then performed with an immediate subpectoral prothesis or delayed with the use of a subpectoral tissue expander. In this way, we aim to meet the patient\u2019s wish to undergo bilateral risk reducing mastectomy in breasts that need ptosis correction without donor-site scarring. This article describes the procedure and reports the preliminary data."

Since studies have validated an increased level of CXCL12 and its receptor in patients with colorectal cancers, CXCL12/CXCR4 axis has been considered as a valuable marker of cancer metastasis. Therefore, identification of CXCR4 inhibitors has great potential to abrogate tumor metastasis. Onbaekwon (OBW) is a complex herbal formula that is derived from the literature of traditional Korean medicine Dongeuibogam . In this study, we demonstrated that OBW suppressed CXCR4 expression in various cancer cell types in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Both proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors had no effect to prevent the OBW-induced suppression of CXCR4, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of OBW was not due to proteolytic degradation but occurred at the transcriptional level. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay further confirmed that OBW could block endogenous activation of nuclear factor kappa B, a key transcription factor that regulates the expression of CXCR4 in colon cancer cells. Consistent with the aforementioned molecular basis, OBW abolished cell invasion induced by CXCL12 in colon cancer cells. Together, our results suggest that OBW, as a novel inhibitor of CXCR4, could be a promising therapeutic agent contributing to cancer treatment."

Two large population-based surveys have been undertaken in India at an interval of 7 years and data from these surveys provided an opportunity to assess the trends in gender differentials in cataract blindness. Data were extracted from the surveys to discern sex differences in cataract blindness. Multivariate analysis was performed to adjust for confounders and their impact on gender differences in cataract blindness. Blindness was defined as presenting vision <20/400 in the better eye, and a cataract blind person was defined as a blind person where the principal cause of loss of vision was cataract. Prevalence of cataract blindness was higher in females compared to males in both surveys. The odds of cataract blindness for females did not change over time as observed in the surveys (1999\u20132001 and 2006\u20132007). Adjusted odds ratio from logistic regression analysis revealed that females continued to be at a higher risk of cataract blindness. Sex differences continued in India in relation to cataract blindness despite the gains made by the national program."

We aimed to identify the important circRNAs in lung adenocarcinoma and intended to predict the functions of them via the bioinformatics analysis. We extracted data from three Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, GSE101586, GSE101684, and GSE104854, and identified the common differentially expressed circRNAs. Agarose gel electrophoresis and Sanger sequencing were used to verify these significant circRNAs. Then, qRT-PCR was performed to validate the expression through matched tissues and cell lines. Afterwards, a ceRNA network was constructed and functional analysis was performed to predict the potential mechanisms of circRNAs. Five circRNAs (hsa_circ_0072088, hsa_circ_0082564, hsa_circ_0008274, hsa_circ_0000519 and hsa_circ_0003528) were identified differentially expressed in the three datasets. Following the Agarose gel electrophoresis and qRT-PCR validation, hsa_circ_0072088 and hsa_circ_0008274 were chosen for further analysis. A ceRNA network of hsa_circ_0072088 and hsa_circ_0008274 was built based on the CSCD/TargetScan/MiRTarbase/StarBase 3.0. Then, the functional analysis showed that several meaningful terms were identified, such as \u201cepithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)\u201d, \u201cCellular response to TGF-\u03b2 stimulus\u201d, \u201cMAPK signaling pathway\u201d, and \u201cPI3K-AKT signaling pathway\u201d. Finally, several significant circRNA/miRNA/mRNA regulatory axes, which were predicted relating to cancer progress, were noted from the network. We identified significant circRNAs and meaningful circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks to provide novel insight into pathogenesis and therapy of lung adenocarcinoma."

Five databases were electronically searched to collect studies describing clinical characteristics of severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients and published between January 1, 2020 and April 12, 2020. Three reviewers independently collected the literature, extracted the required data, and assessed the risk of publication bias of the included studies before including the studies in the meta-analysis. A total of 40 studies involving 2459 patients with severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients were included. Meta-analysis showed that a greater proportion of severe or critically COVID-19 patients were male (62.3%), and the 2 main clinical symptoms were fever (87.4%) and cough (66.3%). Other common clinical symptoms included dyspnea (45.3%), chest tightness (37.4%), fatigue (36.6%), and expectoration (31.9%). Minor symptoms included myalgia (19.5%), dizziness (11.5%), headache (11.4%), diarrhea (11.2%), pharyngalgia (11.0%), nausea, and vomiting (5.9%). Most patients showed elevated levels of C-reactive protein (83.5%) and D-dimer (73.3%), lymphopenia (70.3%), and normal leukocyte counts (56.9%). Other findings included abnormal levels of liver function (39.8%), elevated procalcitonin (36.6%), leukocytosis (21.7%), thrombocytopenia (19.0%), and leucopenia (18.2%).

        "abstract": "It is a crucial issue for patients with refractory ulcerative colitis (UC), including steroid-dependent and steroid-refractory patients, to achieve and maintain steroid-free remission. However, clinical studies focused on the achievement of steroid-free remission in refractory UC patients are insufficient. Cytapheresis (CAP) is a non-pharmacological extracorporeal therapy that is effective for active UC with fewer adverse effects. This study comprised UC patients treated with CAP and suggested the efficacy of CAP for refractory UC patients. To clarify the efficacy of CAP in achieving steroid-free remission in refractory UC patients. We retrospectively reviewed the collected data from 55 patients with refractory UC treated with CAP. We analyzed the following points: (1) Efficacy of the first course of CAP; (2) Efficacy of the second, third, and fourth courses of CAP in patients who experienced relapses during the observation period; (3) Efficacy of CAP in colonic mucosa; and (4) Long-term efficacy of CAP. Clinical efficacy was evaluated using Lichtiger\u2019s clinical activity index or Sutherland index (disease activity index). Mucosal healing was evaluated using Mayo endoscopic subscore. The primary and secondary endpoints were the rate of achievement of steroid-free remission and the rate of sustained steroid-free remission, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired t-test and chi-squared test. The rates of clinical remission, steroid-free remission, and poor effectiveness after CAP were 69.1%, 45.5%, and 30.9%, respectively. There were no significant differences in rate of steroid-free remission between patients with steroid-dependent and steroid-refractory UC. The mean disease activity index and Lichtiger\u2019s clinical activity index scores were significantly decreased after CAP ( P < 0.0001). The rates of steroid-free remission after the second, third, and fourth courses of CAP in patients who achieved steroid-free remission after the first course of CAP were 83.3%, 83.3%, and 60%, respectively. Mucosal healing was observed in all patients who achieved steroid-free remission after the first course of CAP. The rates of sustained steroid-free remission were 68.0%, 60.0%, and 56.0% at 12, 24, and 36 mo after the CAP. Nine patients (36%) had maintained steroid-free remission throughout the observation period. Our results suggest that CAP effectively induces and maintains steroid-free remission in refractory UC and re-induces steroid-free remission in patients achieving steroid-free remission after the first course of CAP."

We present the endovascular treatment of a giant postnephrectomy arteriovenous fistula between the right renal pedicle and the residual renal vein in a 63-year-old man. The purpose of this case report is to demonstrate that the Amplatzer vascular plug (AVP) can be safely positioned to embolize even relatively large arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). Secondly, we illustrate that this occluder can even be introduced to the fistula via a transvenous catheter in cases where it is initially not possible to advance the deployment-catheter through a tortuous feeder artery. Migration of the vascular plug was ruled out at follow-up 4 months subsequently to the intervention. Thus, the Amplatzer vascular plug and the arteriovenous through-and-through guide wire access with subsequent transvenous deployment should be considered in similar cases."

        "abstract": "Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins are the second largest family of transcription factors (TFs) involved in developmental and physiological processes in plants. In this study, 205 putative bHLH TF genes were identified in the genome of Artemisia annua and expression of 122 of these was determined from transcriptomes used to construct the genetic map of A . annua . Analysis of gene expression association allowed division of the 122 bHLH TFs into five groups. Group V, containing 15 members, was tightly associated with artemisinin biosynthesis genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that two bHLH TFs, AabHLH106 and AabHLH112, were clustered with Arabidopsis ICE proteins. AabHLH112 was induced by low temperature, while AabHLH106 was not. We therefore chose AabHLH112 for further examination. AabHLH112 was highly expressed in glandular secretory trichomes, flower buds, and leaves. Dual-luciferase assays demonstrated that AabHLH112 enhanced the promoter activity of artemisinin biosynthesis genes and AaERF1 , an AP2/ERF TF that directly and positively regulates artemisinin biosynthesis genes. Yeast one-hybrid assays indicated that AabHLH112 could bind to the AaERF1 promoter, but not to the promoters of artemisinin biosynthesis genes. Overexpression of AabHLH112 significantly up-regulated the expression levels of AaERF1 and artemisinin biosynthesis genes and consequently promoted artemisinin production. Genome-wide analysis of Artemisia annua bHLH transcription factors reveals the involvement of a cold-responsive bHLH gene AabHLH112 in positively regulating artemisinin biosynthesis via transactivation of ERF1."

The male Wistar rats (Average weight =200 g) were cannulated bilaterally in the BLA, and entered the study (n=6\u20138) after one week. They received seven electro\u2013foot-shock stress sessions on seven consecutive days. Memantine (0.1, 1, and 5 \u03bcg/rat) or saline (0.5 \u03bcL/ rat) was injected into the BLA, five minutes before each stress session. The control groups received the same doses of memantine and no stress. After the end of the stress sessions, blood samples were taken from all animals to evaluate their plasma corticosterone. Also, the spatial learning and memory of the study animals were evaluated using the Barnes maze method. The animals experienced five consecutive days of training on the maze for spatial learning. On the sixth day, their spatial memory was evaluated on the maze. Time, distance, the number of errors, and the taking strategy for reaching the target hole were considered as the parameters for the spatial learning and memory evaluation. Stress increases the plasma corticosterone level, while memantine preadministration reduces the stress effects. Besides, stress increases the time and distance to the target hole and the number of errors. Stress changed the animals\u2019 strategy from serial to random type. However, the intra-BLA memantine reversed all the disturbances induced by the stress. This study indicated that the BLA glutamate NMDA receptors modulate the effect of stress on spatial learning and memory deficit."

Sinks are required to accommodate wastes and emissions. Anthropogenic sinks are provided where capacities of geogenic sinks are lacking. A new indicator discriminates between acceptable and unacceptable flows to sinks. The indicator is applied in three case studies on urban and national scales. Implications for resource, waste and environmental management are discussed. Besides recyclables, the use of materials inevitably yields non-recyclable materials such as emissions and wastes for disposal. These flows must be directed to sinks in a way that no adverse effects arise for humans and the environment. The objective of this paper is to present a new indicator for the assessment of substance flows to sinks on a regional scale. The indicator quantifies the environmentally acceptable mass share of a substance in actual waste and emission flows, ranging from 0% as worst case to 100% as best case. This paper consists of three parts: first, the indicator is defined. Second, a methodology to determine the indicator score is presented, including (i) substance flows analysis and (ii) a distant-to-target approach based on an adaptation of the Ecological Scarcity Method 2006. Third, the metric developed is applied in three case studies including copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) in the city of Vienna, and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in Switzerland. The following results were obtained: in Vienna, 99% of Cu flows to geogenic and anthropogenic sinks are acceptable when evaluated by the distant-to-target approach. However, the 0.7% of Cu entering urban soils and the 0.3% entering receiving waters are beyond the acceptable level. In the case of Pb, 92% of all flows into sinks prove to be acceptable, and 8% are disposed of in local landfills with limited capacity. For PFOS, 96% of all flows into sinks are acceptable. 4% cannot be evaluated due to a lack of normative criteria, despite posing a risk for human health and the environment. The examples demonstrate the need (i) for appropriate data of good quality to calculate the sink indicator and (ii) for standards, needed for the assessment of substance flows to urban soils and receiving waters. This study corroborates that the new indicator is well suited as a base for decisions regarding the control of hazardous substances in waste and environmental management."

There is very limited data on the effects of maximal exercise on muscle fatiguability and exercise capacity in children with cystic fibrosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of progressive maximal exercise training of the lower extremities on exercise capacity and muscle fatiguability in children with cystic fibrosis. Between June and September 2017, eighteen children aged 8\u201312 years were recruited in this study. This study had two groups of children; the CF group consisted of nine children (6 males and 3 females) with cystic fibrosis and the control group consisted of nine healthy age matched children (6 males and 3 females). The children underwent a progressive maximal cardiopulmonary exercise cycling test (CPET), muscle fatigue test, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure a muscle cross-section area (CSA). Also, pulmonary functions were assessed. The findings of this study showed that the CF children had less pulmonary functions, had a less exercise capacity, and had a higher breathing reserve index and oxygen desaturation when compared with healthy children (p<0.05). On the other hand, there was a non-significant difference in muscle fatiguability, muscle cross-section area, and maximal voluntary contraction between the CF and healthy children (p>0.05). This study indicates that progressive maximal exercise doesn't affect muscle fatiguability, muscle cross-section area, and maximal voluntary contraction in CF children with moderate respiratory diseases but includes lower exercise capacity. CF children and healthy age matched children have similar responses to maximal exercise in muscle fatiguability, muscle cross-section area, and maximal voluntary contractions but lower exercise capacity in the CF group."

Medicinal herbs have recently become popular as novel antimicrobial agents. This study aimed to assess the antibacterial effects of hydroalcoholic extracts of Lawsonia inermis, Malva sylvestris , and Boswellia serrata on Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans . Hydroalcoholic extracts of the three medicinal plants were obtained by the maceration technique and A. actinomycetemcomitans was cultured. Antimicrobial efficacy of the three medicinal plants was compared with that of 0.2% chlorhexidine (CHX) according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute protocol using agar disc diffusion and broth microdilution techniques. All tests were repeated three times. Hydroalcoholic extracts of all three plants had antimicrobial activity against A. actinomycetemcomitans . The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of L. inermis , M. sylvestris , and B. serrata was 78.1, 156.2, and 1666 \u03bcg/mL with no significant difference between them. The MIC of CHX was 3.33 \u03bcg/mL, which was significantly higher than that of B. serrata extract. Given that further in vivo studies confirm other properties of these extracts and their safety in terms of cytotoxicity and mutagenicity, hydroalcoholic extracts of L. inermis and M. sylvestris may be used in mouthwashes or local delivery systems to affect periodontal biofilm."

According to recent studies, VSTM consists of three stages \u2013 iconic memory, fragile VSTM, and visual working memory \u2013 with increasingly stricter capacity limits and progressively longer lifetimes. Still, the resolution (or amount of visual detail) of each VSTM stage has remained unexplored and we test this in the present study. We presented people with a change detection task that measures the capacity of all three forms of VSTM, and we added an identification display after each change trial that required people to identify the \u201cpre-change\u201d object. Accurate change detection plus pre-change identification requires subjects to have a high-resolution representation of the \u201cpre-change\u201d object, whereas change detection or identification only can be based on the hunch that something has changed, without exactly knowing what was presented before. We observed that people maintained 6.1 objects in iconic memory, 4.6 objects in fragile VSTM, and 2.1 objects in visual working memory. Moreover, when people detected the change, they could also identify the pre-change object on 88% of the iconic memory trials, on 71% of the fragile VSTM trials and merely on 53% of the visual working memory trials. This suggests that people maintain many high-resolution representations in iconic memory and fragile VSTM, but only one high-resolution object representation in visual working memory."

For data collection, a questionnaire was designed and its validity and reliability was confirmed (Cronbach's \u03b1 =0.85). The questionnaire included eight general questions and eight questions about practice with regard to the prevention and treatment of WSL. Data were analyzed by descriptive tests, ANOVA test, and t -test in SPSS 20 software. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The mean score of orthodontists\u2019 practice was 7.62 (range: 0\u20138), and 94.4% of the participants were rated as good, while 3.7% and 1.9% were rated as moderate and weak, respectively.

With increasing participants\u2019 age, their practice has been improved ( P = 0.001), but there was no significant relation between years of experience and their practice ( P = 0.230). Nearly 94.4% of the orthodontists prescribed fluoride products. Toothpastes and fluoride mouth rinses were the most common prescribed products (34%). With regard to Iranian orthodontists\u2019 practice, it was fortunate to note that majority of the respondents were taking care of their patients with regarding to the prevention and treatment of WSLs. For enhancing their competencies, it is recommended to plan educational courses which are useful for promoting their knowledge and practice about new products and procedures used for the prevention and treatment of WSLs."

        "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common interstitial pneumonia and the most aggressive interstitial lung disease. Usually, IPF is confirmed by the histopathological pattern of typical interstitial pneumonia and requires an integrated multidisciplinary approach from pulmonologists, radiologists and pathologists. However, these diagnoses are performed at an advanced stage of IPF. At present, pathway-based detection requires investigation, as it can be performed at an early stage of the disease. The aim of the present study was to find an effective method of diagnosing IPF at an early stage. Microarray data for E-GEOD-33566 were downloaded from the ArrayExpress database. Human pathways were downloaded from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database. An individual pathway-based method to diagnose IPF at an early stage was introduced. Pathway statistics were analyzed with an individualized pathway aberrance score. P-values were obtained with different methods, including the Wilcoxon test, linear models for microarray data (Limma) test and attract methods, generating three pathway groups. Support vector machines (SVM) were used to identify the best group for diagnosing IPF at an early stage. There were 106 differential pathways in Wilcoxon-based KEGG Pathway (n>5) group, 100 in the Limma-based KEGG Pathway (n>5) group, and seven in the attract-based KEGG Pathway (n>5) group. The pathway statistics of these differential pathways in three groups were analyzed with linear SVM. The results demonstrated that the Wilcoxon-based KEGG Pathway (n>5) group performed best in diagnosing IPF."

        "abstract": "Excess adiposity is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease due to metabolic changes in the body. Visceral obesity increases the risk of diabetes mellitus through adipocytokines and hence the effective targeting therapies are essential to control obesity in high-risk individuals. The study\u2019s main objective was to evaluate the effect of add-on therapy of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors on visceral fat-associated serum adipokines. The study included 90 subjects diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The blood samples were taken before starting first-line therapy with metformin, 12 weeks after starting metformin therapy and 12 weeks after starting add-on therapy. Serum adipokines were analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level was estimated with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The biochemical variables were measured using Cobas \u00ae 6000 analyzer. The mean adiponectin level was significantly elevated with add-on therapy using SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP4 inhibitors (P < 0.001). The mean retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) and visfatin levels were reduced considerably (P < 0.001). The SGLT2 inhibitors are more effective on serum FABP4 in patients with type 2 diabetes (P = 0.038). The mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial blood glucose (PPBG) and HbA1c levels were reduced significantly with add-on therapy (P < 0.001). Lipid profile was also altered significantly with this add-on therapy (P < 0.001). The results indicate that add-on therapy exerts a beneficial effect in type 2 diabetic patients insufficiently controlled with metformin only by altering the visceral fat-associated adipokine levels and controlling the metabolic activities."

We therefore investigated the prolactin's effects on erection of the penile tip and base, with a cross-sectional study of 135 patients with erectile dysfunction, based on scores of \u226421 on the International Index of Erectile Function-5. All patients were tested for nocturnal penile tumescence, blood pressure, serum glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, estradiol, testosterone, and progesterone. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the associations between prolactin levels and erection at the penile tip and base. We found no obvious relationship between erection time at penile tip and prolactin levels, but observed a negative correlation between base erection time and prolactin level (hazard ratio: \u22122.68; 95% confidence interval [CI]: \u22125.13\u2013\u22120.22). With increasing prolactin concentration, multivariate analysis showed obvious reduction in base erection time among patients with normal Rigiscan results (hazard ratio: \u22123.10; 95% CI: \u22127.96\u20131.77; P < 0.05). Our data indicate that prolactin inhibits penile erection, particularly at the penile base. In addition, when the effective erection time of the penile base lasts longer than 10 min, prolactin has a more obvious inhibitory effect on penile base erection."

Trichoscopy is a non-invasive, in-office method helpful in establishing the correct diagnosis in patients with hair loss and inflammatory hair disorders. The objective was to review and analyze current data on the trichoscopy of tinea capitis. A systematic review of the\u00a0literature was conducted using the PubMed, EBSCO and Scopus databases. The search terms included \u2018tinea capitis\u2019 combined with \u2018trichoscopy\u2019, \u2018dermatoscopy\u2019, \u2018dermoscopy\u2019, \u2018videodermatoscopy\u2019 or \u2018videodermoscopy\u2019. Of 326 articles, 37 were considered eligible for the quantitative analysis. The most characteristic (with a high predictive value) trichoscopic findings of tinea capitis included comma hairs (51%), corkscrew hairs (32%), Morse code-like hairs (22%), zigzag hairs (21%), bent hairs (27%), block hairs (10%) and i-hairs (10%). Other common, but not characteristic, trichoscopic features were broken hairs (57%), black dots (34%), perifollicular scaling (59%) and diffuse scaling (89%). Morse code-like hairs, zigzag hairs, bent hairs and diffuse scaling were only observed in Microsporum tinea capitis (8/29, 28%; 6/29, 21%; 4/29, 14% and 4/29, 14%, respectively). In Trichophyton tinea capitis, corkscrew hairs were more commonly detected compared to Microsporum tinea capitis (21/38, 55% vs 3/29, 10%). The presence of characteristic trichoscopic features of tinea capitis is sufficient to establish the initial diagnosis and introduce treatment before culture results are available. Trichoscopy may be useful in distinguishing between Microsporum and Trichophyton tinea capitis."

        "abstract": "Aging is associated with progressive loss of musculoskeletal performance. Exercise interventions can improve physical function in the elderly but there is a paucity of comparative assessments in order to understand what specific goals can be achieved particularly with less demanding exercise interventions readily accessible for untrained men. Prospective randomized, controlled, single center exploratory trial to compare four distinct exercise interventions, i.e. Resistance Training (RT), Whole Body Vibration Exercise (WBV), Qi Gong (QG) and wearing a Spinal orthosis (SO) for 6\u00a0months in men at risk for osteoporosis aged 65\u201390\u00a0years. Primary endpoint was change in isometric one repetition maximum force trunk strength for extension (TSE) and flexion (TSF) compared to baseline, secondary endpoints covered key parameters of geriatric functional assessment, including Handgrip Strength (HS), Chair-Rise-Test (CRT), Usual Gait Speed (UGS) and Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG). Altogether 47 men (mean age 77 \u00b16.1\u00a0years) were randomized to RT, ( n =\u00a011) WBV ( n =\u00a013), QG ( n =\u00a010) and SO(n\u00a0=\u00a013). RT, defined as reference exercise intervention, lead to significant improvements for TSE ( p =\u00a00.009) and TSF ( p =\u00a00.013) and was significantly superior in the between-group analysis for TSE ( p =\u00a00.038). Vibration exercise caused sign. Improvements in TSE ( p =\u00a00.014) and CRT ( p =\u00a00.005), the Spinal orthosis improved CRT ( p =\u00a00.003) and Gait Speed ( p =\u00a00.027), while the QG intervention did not attain any sig. Developments. Subgroup analyses revealed most pronounced musculoskeletal progress in vulnerable patients (age\u00a0\u2265\u00a080\u00a0years, pre-sarcopenia, multimorbidity \u22653chronic diseases). Irrespective of the type of exercise, participants \u226580\u00a0years experienced significant gains in TSE ( p =\u00a00.029) and CRT ( p =\u00a00.017). Presarcopenic subjects (Skeletal muscle Index (SMI) \u226410.75\u00a0kg/m 2 ) improved in TSE ( p =\u00a00.003), CRT ( p =\u00a00.001) and UGS ( p =\u00a00.016). Multimorbid participants achieved sig. Gains in TSE ( p <\u00a00.001), TSF ( p =\u00a00.002), UGS ( p =\u00a00.036) and HS ( p =\u00a00.046). In this exploratory trial we found that simple exercise interventions are feasible in elderly men eliciting specific benefits, i.e. improvements are attained in those tasks addressed with the respective exercise modality. While targeted resistance training is superior in increasing TSE, alternative simple exercise interventions also appear to elicit beneficial effects, even in vulnerable patients, i.e. those with low muscle mass, above 80\u00a0years of age or multimorbidity. \u2022 Simple exercise interventions are safe and feasible in elderly man with elevated fracture risk. \u2022 Improvements are observed in those tasks specifically addressed by the respective exercise. \u2022 Simple exercise interventions are particularly effective in vulnerable patients (Presarcopenic, \u226580\u00a0years old, multimorbid). \u2022 Even vulnerable patients at risk for muscular deficits can experience some benefits from exercise.

        "abstract": "Emergence of chloroquine (CQ) resistance among different strains of Plasmodium falciparum is the worst catastrophe that has ever perplexed the dedicated efforts to eradicate malaria. This urged the scientists to search for new alternatives or sensitizers to augment its antiplasmodium effect. In this experiment, the potential of embelin, isolated from Embelia ribes, to inhibit the growth and sensitize CQ action was screened using SYBRE-green-I based drug sensitivity and isobologram assays, respectively. Its effect on red blood cells stability was screened to assess its safety. To explore its molecular mechanism, its effect on plasmodial Hemozoin and the in vitro \u03b2-hematin formation was screened as well. Furthermore, its anti-oxidant activity was measured using the conventional in vitro tests and its molecular characters were obtained using Molispiration program. The results showed that its anti-plasmodial effect was weaker than CQ but synergism was obtained when they were combined at ratios lower than 5:5 CQ/embelin. Furthermore, \u03b2-hematin formation was inhibited by embelin without showing any synergism after mixing with CQ. Overall, embelin is not ideal to be suggested as a conventional antiplasmodium but it has a potential to ameliorate CQ resistance. Furthermore, its action is not related to its impact on hemozoin formation. Further, investigations are recommended to illustrate its detailed mechanism of action.

Use of the 6-MWT to determine an individual initial training load in walking training on a treadmill in the early phase of cardiac rehabilitation in men after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Twenty-two men aged 54 to 74 years, up to 3 months after CABG surgery participated in walking training on a treadmill (12\u201315 sessions). Patients underwent the initial and final treadmill exercise stress test (TEST) and the 6-MWT. Based on 6-MWT results, the initial training load was prescribed. Before the 6-MWT and 3 minutes after its completion, lactate concentration was determined. The 6-MWT distance increased from 420 \u00b180 m to 519 \u00b161 m ( p < 0.001), and the energy expenditure from 4.4 \u00b11.4 MET to 6.3 \u00b11.3 MET ( p < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between 6-MWT distance and energy expenditure in the TEST before rehabilitation ( r = 0.60, p = 0.005), and after rehabilitation ( r = 0.75, p < 0.001). A negative correlation was found between the baseline 6-MWT distance and distance increment in the final 6-MWT ( r = \u20130.66, p = 0.002). The 6-MWT did not induce hyperlactatemia. The 6-MWT can be used in exercise intensity prescription, especially for determining the individual initial training load, load progression, as well as its correction during follow-up tests."

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of ED and its associated factors among children who underwent surgeries at a major tertiary healthcare facility in Saudi Arabia. Between March and August 2018, a retrospective cohort study was conducted based on a review of 413 medical charts of children (<14 years) who underwent an elective/nonemergency surgery and then were admitted to a Post Anesthesia Care Unit. Patient and surgery-related characteristics were analyzed as potential factors associated with ED. The anxiety level was assessed preoperatively using the Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (four domains), while the ED was detected after surgery using the Watcha scale (child is agitated and thrashing around). The leading surgery category was ear, nose, and throat surgeries [184 (44.6%)] and dental surgeries [109 (26.4%)]. Almost one-third received only general anesthesia (31.2%), while 271 (68.8%) received an additional regional block/skin infiltrate. The anxiety domains preop showed that the percentage mean score \u00b1 standard deviation of expression of emotions was 37.1 \u00b1 21.6, apparent arousal 33.7 \u00b1 20.4, activeness 30.1 \u00b1 13.5, and vocalization 26.9 \u00b1 20.3. The prevalence of ED among children who underwent surgeries during the 6-month period was 23 (6.6%). Almost 18.8% of those who received opioid analgesics (fentanyl alone) developed ED, while 12% of those who received both opioid and nonopioid analgesics (fentanyl/paracetamol) developed ED. ED was significantly associated with longer recovery duration 69.5 + 27.1 min, P = 0.007. Binary logistics regression analysis showed that participants who did not receive Precedex were adj. odds ratio = 10.3 (2.4\u201348.9) times more likely to develop ED, compared with those who received it, adj. P = 0.003. Lower preoperative scores of expression of emotions and higher scores of apparent arousal were significantly associated with ED, adj. P = 0.035 and adj. P = 0.023, respectively. ED appears to be inevitable in postoperative settings. It is crucial to address any preoperative anxiety assessment as it is associated with ED. Anxiety remains a modifiable factor that can be managed, as well as to the administration of Precedex and adjunct analgesic treatments."

        "abstract": "It has been suggested that the way in which owners interact with their dogs can largely vary and influence the dog-owner bond, but very few objective studies, so far, have addressed how the owner interacts with the dog. The goal of the present study was to record dog owners' interaction styles by means of objective observation and coding. The experiment included eight standardized situations in which owners of pet dogs were asked to perform specific tasks including both positive (i.e. playing, teaching a new task, showing a preference towards an object in a food searching task, greeting after separation) and potentially distressing tasks (i.e. physical restriction during DNA sampling, putting a T-shirt onto the dog, giving basic obedience commands while the dog was distracted). The video recordings were coded off-line using a specifically designed coding scheme including scores for communication, social support, warmth, enthusiasm, and play style, as well as frequency of behaviors like petting, praising, commands, and attention sounds. Exploratory Factor Analysis of the 20 variables measured revealed 3 factors, labeled as Owner Warmth, Owner Social Support, and Owner Control, which can be viewed as analogues to parenting style dimensions. The experimental procedure introduced here represents the first standardized measure of interaction styles of dog owners. The methodology presented here is a useful tool to investigate individual variation in the interaction style of pet dog owners that can be used to explain differences in the dog-human relationship, dogs' behavioral outcomes, and dogs stress coping strategies, all crucial elements both from a theoretical and applied point of view."

The RSM was undertaken to optimize the culture conditions under different cultivation conditions (medium concentration, induction time and inducer concentration), designed by the factorial Box-Bhenken using Minitab 17 statistical software. From the randomized combination, 15 treatments and three center point repetitions were obtained. Furthermore, expression methods were carried out in the flask scale fermentation in accordance with the predetermined design. Then, the MPT64 protein in the cytoplasm of E.\u00a0coli cell was isolated and characterized using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrilamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) then quantified using the ImageJ program. The optimum conditions were two-fold medium concentration (tryptone 20 mg/mL, yeast extract 10 mg/mL, and sodium chloride 20 mg/mL), 5 h of induction time and 4 mM rhamnose. The average concentration of recombinant MPT64 at optimum conditions was 0.0392 mg/mL, higher than the predicted concentration of 0.0311 mg/mL.

        "abstract": "A common characteristic of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is that symptoms, including abdominal pain and abnormal bowel habits, are often triggered or exacerbated during periods of stress and anxiety. However, the impact of anxiety and affective disorders on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is poorly understood and may in part explain the lack of effective therapeutic approaches to treat IBS. The amygdala is an important structure for regulating anxiety with the central nucleus of the amygdala facilitating the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic nervous system in response to stress. Moreover, chronic stress enhances function of the amygdala and promotes neural plasticity throughout the amygdaloid complex. This review outlines the latest findings obtained from human studies and animal models related to the role of the emotional brain in the regulation of enteric function, specifically how increasing the gain of the amygdala to induce anxiety-like behavior using corticosterone or chronic stress increases responsiveness to both visceral and somatic stimuli in rodents. A focus of the review is the relative importance of mineralocorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid receptor-mediated mechanisms within the amygdala in the regulation of anxiety and nociceptive behaviors that are characteristic features of IBS. This review also discusses several outstanding questions important for future research on the role of the amygdala in the generation of abnormal GI function that may lead to potential targets for new therapies to treat functional bowel disorders such as IBS."

        "abstract": "Cisplatin (CDDP) plays a vital role in the treatment of advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC); however, the development of chemoresistance depletes the overall benefit of CDDP. This study harbored the aim to investigate the role of a novel circular RNA (circRNA), circ_0000260, in DDP-resistant GAC and provide a potential mechanism to explain its function. The morphology of tumor tissues and normal tissues was observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The isolated exosomes were observed and examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The expression of circ_0000260, miR-129-5p and matrix metalloproteinase 11 (MMP11) mRNA was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein levels of CD63, CD81, fibronectin, vitronectin and MMP11 were detected by Western blot. Cell viability, colony formation, cell apoptosis, migration, invasion and cell adhesion were monitored by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry assay, scratch assay, transwell assay and cell adhesion assay, respectively. The interaction between miR-129-5p and circ_0000260 or MMP11 predicted by bioinformatics analysis was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Animal experiments were performed in nude mice to explore the role of circ_0000260 in vivo. The expression of circ_0000260 was promoted in tumor tissues and serum-derived exosomes of GAC patients, and circ_0000260 expression in CDDP-resistant tumor tissues was higher than that in CDDP-sensitive tumor tissues. Circ_0000260 knockdown lessened CDDP chemoresistance, suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion and adhesion, and induced apoptosis. In mechanism, circ_0000260 regulated the expression of MMP11 by targeting miR-129-5p. MiR-129-5p inhibition could reverse the functions of circ_0000260 knockdown, and MMP11 knockdown could also reverse the effects of miR-129-5p inhibition. Besides, circ_0000260 knockdown attenuated CDDP resistance during tumor growth in vivo by regulating the expression of miR-129-5p and MMP11. Circ_0000260 regulated CDDP chemoresistance of GAC by promoting MMP11 expression via targeting miR-129-5p."

        "abstract": "This study aimed to translate, culturally adopt and validate a Chinese version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) for use in patients with upper extremity musculoskeletal diseases in Hong Kong. We followed a standard five-stage process: forward translation, synthesis, backward translation, expert panel review and field-testing to achieve linguistic and conceptual equivalence. The version was officially known as Chinese (Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong version) DASH. (Chinese QMH,HK version DASH) ( http://www.dash.iwh.on.ca/sites/dash/public/translations/DASH_Chinese_HK_2013.pdf ). Its internal consistency was then evaluated with 138 participants suffering from upper extremity musculoskeletal conditions. The results were high in DASH-Disability/Symptom module (DASH-DS) (Cronbach alpha 0.97), DASH-Work module (DASH-W) (Cronbach alpha 0.97) and DASH-Sports / Performing Arts module (DASH-SM) (Cronbach alpha 0.99). The test-retest reliability was evaluated with a subgroup of participants who had completed the Chinese (QMH,HK version) DASH on two occasions, with a median interval of 6.5 days. The results were excellent among DASH-DS Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)\u2009=\u20090.98 and DASH-W (ICC\u2009=\u20090.90). Good test-retest reliability was found in DASH-SM (ICC\u2009=\u20090.89). Construct validity of DASH-DS showed good correlation with the sub-domains of physical functioning (r\u2009=\u2009\u2212.564) and social functioning (r\u2009=\u2009\u2212.544) of the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). Similarly, construct validity of DASH-W also showed good correlation with the sub-domains of physical functioning (r\u2009=\u2009\u2212.510) and bodily pain (r\u2009=\u2009\u2212.503) of SF-36. The Chinese (Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong version) Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand is considered as a reliable and valid instrument that can provide a standardised measure of patient-centred outcomes for patients with upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders in Hong Kong."

        "abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer is the fifth commonest cancer among women and the leading cause of gynecological cancer death in the UK. Most women present with advanced disease, mainly because the nonspecific nature of the symptoms lead to diagnostic delays. Recent data have shown a fall in ovarian cancer mortality rates in the UK, but rates are still higher when compared to other European countries or the USA. In addition, surgeons in the UK achieve on average lower optimal surgical cytoreduction rates in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Despite a wealth of information on epidemiological risk factors, the pathogenesis of epithelial ovarian cancer remains largely unknown. This review presents the most recent data on incidence, mortality, and survival for epithelial ovarian cancer in the UK. Time trends, trends by age, international comparisons, and regional variation in incidence, survival, and mortality are presented within the context of a major reorganization of cancer services that took place in the UK over 10 years ago. Centralization of cancer services has meant that women with ovarian cancer receive treatment in specialist Cancer Centers. "

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) accelerates muscle protein degradation by stimulating the ubiquitin proteasome system through activation of the E3 ligases, Atrogin-1/MaFbx and MuRF-1. Forkhead transcription factors (FoxO) can control the expression of these E3 ligases, but the contribution of individual FoxOs to muscle wasting is unclear. To study this we created mice with a muscle-specific FoxO1 deletion. The absence of FoxO1 blocked 70% of the increase in E3 ligases induction by CKD as well as the proteolysis and loss of muscle mass. Thus, FoxO1 has a role in controlling ubiquitin proteasome system-related proteolysis. Since microRNA (miR)-486 reportedly dampens FoxO1 expression and its activity, we transfected a miR-486 mimic into primary cultures of myotubes and found this blocked dexamethasone-stimulated protein degradation without influencing protein synthesis. It also decreased FoxO1 protein translation and increased FoxO1 phosphorylation by down-regulation of PTEN phosphatase, a negative regulator of p-Akt. To test its efficacy in vivo, we electroporated miR-486 into muscles and found expression of the E3 ligases was suppressed and muscle mass increased despite CKD. Thus, FoxO1 is a dominant mediator of CKD-induced muscle wasting and miR-486 coordinately decreases FoxO1 and PTEN to protect against this catabolic response."

Some patients have premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) related to exercise, but the significance of exercise\u2010related PVCs in patients with Brugada syndrome is still unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the significance of exercise\u2010related PVCs for predicting occurrence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) in patients with Brugada syndrome. The subjects were 307 patients with Brugada syndrome who performed a treadmill exercise test. We evaluated the occurrence of PVCs at rest, during exercise and at the peak of exercise, and during recovery after exercise (0\u20135\u00a0minutes). We followed the patients for 92\u00b168\u00a0months and evaluated the occurrence of VF. PVCs occurred in 82 patients (27%) at the time of treadmill exercise test: PVCs appeared at rest in 14 patients (4%), during exercise in 60 patients (20%), immediately after exercise (0\u20131.5\u00a0minutes) in 28 patients (9%), early after exercise (1.5\u20133\u00a0minutes) in 18 patients (6%), and late after exercise (3\u20135\u00a0minutes) in 12 patients (4%). Thirty patients experienced VF during follow\u2010up. Multivariable analysis including symptoms, spontaneous type 1 ECG, and PVCs in the early recovery phase showed that these factors were independently associated with VF events during follow\u2010up. PVCs early after an exercise test are associated with future occurrence of VF events. Rebound of vagal nerve activity at the early recovery phase would promote ST\u2010segment augmentation and PVCs in high\u2010risk patients with Brugada syndrome."

Several mutations and epigenetic alterations are acquired during colorectal carcinogenesis. These are responsible for the cell cycle regulation, cellular sensitivity to pro- and antiapoptotic factors, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasiveness, as well as metastatic potential. The molecular alterations, along with their morphological expressions, have been recognised in detail, and most of the CRC cases can be attributed to either adenoma-carcinoma or serrated neoplasia pathways: in the first, the antiapoptotic features prevail; while in the second, the proliferative activity is of the utmost importance. The aim of the work is to discuss the influence of selected drugs and dietary compounds on the proliferation and apoptosis in CRC."

        "abstract": "Myopia is a common disorder, affecting approximately one-third of the US population and over 90% of the population in some East Asian countries. High amounts of myopia are associated with an increased risk of sight-threatening problems, such as retinal detachment, choroidal degeneration, cataracts, and glaucoma. Slowing the progression of myopia could potentially benefit millions of children in the USA. To date, few strategies used for myopia control have proven to be effective. Treatment options such as undercorrection of myopia, gas permeable contact lenses, and bifocal or multifocal spectacles have all been proven to be ineffective for myopia control, although one recent randomized clinical trial using executive top bifocal spectacles on children with progressive myopia has shown to decrease the progression to nearly half of the control subjects. The most effective methods are the use of orthokeratology contact lenses, soft bifocal contact lenses, and topical pharmaceutical agents such as atropine or pirenzepine. Although none of these modalities are US Food and Drug Administration-approved to slow myopia progression, they have been shown to slow the progression by approximately 50% with few risks. Both orthokeratology and soft bifocal contact lenses have shown to slow myopia progression by slightly less than 50% in most studies. Parents and eye care practitioners should work together to determine which modality may be best suited for a particular child. Topical pharmaceutical agents such as anti-muscarinic eye drops typically lead to light sensitivity and poor near vision. The most effective myopia control is provided by atropine, but is rarely prescribed due to the side effects. Pirenzepine provides myopia control with little light sensitivity and few near-vision problems, but it is not yet commercially available as an eye drop or ointment. Several studies have shown that lower concentrations of atropine slow the progression of myopia control with fewer side effects than 1% atropine. While the progression of myopic refractive error is slowed with lower concentration of atropine, the growth of the eye is not, indicating a potentially reversible form of myopia control that may diminish after discontinuation of the eye drops. This review provides an overview of the myopia control information available in the literature and raises questions that remain unanswered, so that eye care practitioners and parents can potentially learn the methods that may ultimately improve a child\u2019s quality of life or lower the risk of sight-threatening complications.

        "abstract": "Successful endodontic therapy is mainly governed by the satisfactory sealing ability of the applied root canal sealer. Also, tolerability of root canal structure to accommodate the presence of a sealer participates in the efficiency of the treatment. Hence, this study was aimed to extrapolate our previous one that was concerned with the preparation and evaluation of novel nature-based root canal sealers. Our current work is focused on the evaluation of sealing ability and in vivo biocompatibility. Egyptian propolis was extracted (ProE) and encapsulated in polymeric nanoparticles (ProE-loaded NPs). Two root sealers, PE sealer and PE nanosealer, were fabricated by incorporating ProE and ProE-loaded NPs, respectively. The sealing ability of the developed sealers was tested by a dye extraction method. An in vivo biocompatibility study was conducted using a subcutaneous implantation method for two and four weeks. At the same time, a model sealer (AH Plus\u00ae) was subjected to the same procedures to enable accurate and equitable results. The teeth treated with PE sealer exhibited weak sealing ability which did not differ from that of unfilled teeth. PE nanosealer enhanced the sealing ability similarly to the model sealer with minimal apical microleakage. Studying in vivo biocompatibility indicated the capability of the three tested sealers to induce cell proliferation and tissue healing. However, PE nanosealer had superior biocompatibility, with higher potential for cell regeneration and tissue proliferation. PE nanosealer can be presented as an innovative root canal sealer, with enhanced sealing ability as well as in vivo biocompatibility. It can be applied as a substitute for the currently available sealers that demonstrate hazardous effects."

Meta-analysis of 24 studies found increased risk of death associated with NO2. Weak associations were observed for peak period O3 and mortality. High levels of heterogeneity were observed. Certainty in NO2 associations with mortality was generally low/moderate. WHO has published several volumes of Global Air Quality Guidelines to provide guidance on the health risks associated with exposure to outdoor air pollution. As new scientific evidence is generated, air quality guidelines need to be periodically revised and, where necessary, updated. The aims of the study were 1) to summarise the available evidence on the effect of long-term exposure to ozone (O 3 ) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) on mortality; 2) and to assess concentration response functions (CRF), their shape and the minimum level of exposures measured in studies to support WHO\u2019s update of the global air quality guidelines. We conducted a systematic literature search of the Medline, Embase and Web of Science databases following a protocol proposed by WHO and applied Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting our results. Study eligibility criteria: Cohort studies in human populations (including sub-groups at risk) exposed to long-term concentrations of NO 2 and O 3 . Outcomes assessed were all-cause, respiratory, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Acute Lower Respiratory Infection (ALRI) mortality. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Studies included in the meta-analyses were assessed using a new Risk of Bias instrument developed by a group of experts convened by WHO. Study results are presented in forest plots and quantitative meta-analyses were conducted using random effects models. The certainty of evidence was assessed using a newly developed adaptation of GRADE. The review identified 2068 studies of which 95 were subject to full-text review with 45 meeting the inclusion criteria. An update in September 2018 identified 159 studies with 1 meeting the inclusion criteria. Of the 46 included studies, 41 reported results for NO 2 and 20 for O 3 . The majority of studies were from the USA and Europe with the remainder from Canada, China and Japan. Forty-two studies reported results for all-cause mortality and 22 for respiratory mortality. Associations for NO 2 and mortality were positive; random-effects summary relative risks (RR) were 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.04), 1.03 (1.00, 1.05), 1.03 (1.01, 1.04) and 1.06 (1.02, 1.10) per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m 3 for all-cause (24 cohorts), respiratory (15 cohorts), COPD (9 cohorts) and ALRI (5 cohorts) mortality respectively. The review identified high levels of heterogeneity for all causes of death except COPD. A small number of studies investigated the shape of the concentration\u2013response relationship and generally found little evidence to reject the assumption of linearity across the concentration range. Studies of O 3 using annual metrics showed the associations with all-cause and respiratory mortality were 0.97 (0.93, 1.02) and 0.99 (0.89, 1.11) per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m 3 respectively. For studies using peak O 3 metrics, the association with all-cause mortality was 1.01 (1.00, 1.02) and for respiratory mortality 1.02 (0.99, 1.05), each per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m 3 . The review identified high levels of heterogeneity. Few studies investigated the shape of the concentration\u2013response relationship. Certainty in the associations (adapted GRADE) with mortality was rated low to moderate for each exposure-outcome pair, except for NO 2 and COPD mortality which was rated high. The substantial heterogeneity for most outcomes in the review requires explanation. The evidence base is limited in terms of the geographical spread of the study populations and, for some outcomes, the small number of independent cohorts for meta-analysis precludes meaningful meta-regression to explore causes of heterogeneity. Relatively few studies assessed specifically the shape of the CRF or multi-pollutant models. The short-comings in the existing literature base makes determining the precise nature (magnitude and linearity) of the associations challenging. Certainty of evidence assessments were moderate or low for both NO 2 and O 3 for all causes of mortality except for NO 2 and COPD mortality where the certainty of the evidence was judged as high."

        "abstract": "Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are recently emerged zoonotic paramyxoviruses exclusively grouped within a new genus, Henipavirus. These viruses cause fatal disease in a wide range of species, including humans. Both NiV and HeV have continued to re-emerge sporadically in Bangladesh and Australia, respectively. There are currently no therapeutics or vaccines available to treat Henipavirus infection and both are classified as BSL4 pathogens. RNA interference (RNAi) is a process by which double-stranded RNA directs sequence-specific degradation of messenger RNA in animal and plant cells. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) mediate RNAi by inhibiting gene expression of homologous mRNA and our preliminary studies suggest RNAi may be a useful approach to developing novel therapies for these highly lethal pathogens. Eight NiV siRNA molecules (four L and four N gene specific), two HeV N gene specific, and two non-specific control siRNA molecules were designed and tested for their ability to inhibit a henipavirus minigenome replication system (which does not require the use of live virus) in addition to live virus infections in vitro. In the minigenome assay three out of the four siRNAs that targeted the L gene of NiV effectively inhibited replication. In contrast, only NiV N gene siRNAs were effective in reducing live NiV replication, suggesting inhibition of early, abundantly expressed gene transcripts may be more effective than later, less abundant transcripts. Additionally, some of the siRNAs effective against NiV infection were only partially effective inhibitors of HeV infection. An inverse correlation between the number of nucleotide mismatches and the efficacy of siRNA inhibition was observed. The demonstration that RNAi effectively inhibits henipavirus replication in vitro, is a novel approach and may provide an effective therapy for these highly lethal, zoonotic pathogens."

Pubmed and Google Scholar are searched with the following key terms- \u201cCOVID-19\u201d, \u201cSARS-CoV2\u201d, \u201cPandemic\u201d, \u201cAddiction\u201d, \u201cOpioid\u201d, \u201cAlcohol\u201d, \u201cSmoking\u201d, \u201cAddiction Psychiatry\u201d, \u201cDeaddiction\u201d, \u201cSubstance use disorders\u201d, \u201cBehavioral addiction\u201d. Few newspaper reports related to COVID-19 and addiction have also been added as per context. People with SUD are at greater risk of worse COVID-19 outcome. There is surge of addictive behaviors (both new and relapse) including behavioral addiction in this period. Withdrawal emergencies and death are also being increasingly reported. Addicted people are especially facing difficulties in accessing the healthcare services which are making them prone to procure drugs by illegal means. COVID-19 and addiction are the two pandemics which are on the verge of collision causing major public health threat. While every effort must be taken to make the public aware of deleterious effects of SUD on COVID-19 prognosis, the resumption of deaddiction services and easier accessibility of prescription drugs are needs of the hour."

        "abstract": "Burns are among the most prevalent injuries in humans with high cost in health care and heavy prolonged or permanent physical, psychological and social consequences. Commercial antimicrobial creams and dressing agents are unsuccessful in healing deep burn wounds. A study was conducted to assess the impact of crude linseed oil (LSO) topical application on burn wounds healing in rabbits in comparison with untreated wounds (NAT) and those treated with Vaseline gel (VAG) and Cicatryl-Bio ointment (CBO). By the 28 th day post burning, skin biopsies were analyzed for histological and cytological lesions. The presence of various bioactive phytochemical groups in linseed was also screened. Phytochemical screening has resulted in high concentrations of flavonoids and terpenoids, low amounts of catechic tannins and total absence of alkaloids and saponosides. All along the trial, the rate of wounds contraction was found to be significantly higher in burns treated with LSO which had also a significant shorter healing period (26\u00b15.89 days) as compared to the other treatments. LSO healed wounds included less inflammatory cells, complete epithelium regeneration with a reduced thickness of the new formed dermis, discreet fibrosis, enhanced neo-vascularization, increased number of collagen fibers, fibroblasts and many myofibroblasts. Additionally, no adverse effects of LSO on cicatrization process were recorded. These findings prove the safety and efficaciousness of linseed oil topical application in the therapy of burn wounds."

        "abstract": "The present study aimed to systematically analyze the value of microRNA-122 (miRNA-122) in the diagnosis and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other types of cancer. First, the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect the expression levels of miRNA-122 in the serum samples of patients with HCC, benign lesions and healthy volunteers. Next, miRNA-seq data of miRNA-122 from The Cancer Genome Atlas database were used to analyze the differential expression and overall survival rate associated with a variety of types of cancer. Meanwhile, the target gene prediction of miRNA-122 was performed using four different software programs. Finally, 353 significant target genes were identified for Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional enrichment analysis. Finally, it was demonstrated that the expression levels of miRNA-122 in the HCC group were increased compared with the healthy group (P<0.001), but decreased with respect to the benign group (P<0.001). In addition, the combination of the miRNA-122 and a fetoprotein may further improve the diagnostic accuracy between the HCC and healthy groups (area under the curve, 0.980; 95% confidence interval, 0.958\u20131.000). It was also demonstrated that miRNA-122 exhibited significantly differential expression and the overall survival rate was predicted for various other types of cancer, including colorectal cancer, renal carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, prostate cancer and thyroid carcinoma. Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that the target genes of miRNA-122 may contribute to the composition of the nucleus and cytoplasm, and regulate a variety of biological processes, including cardiac muscle cell differentiation and glucose metabolic processes via protein biosynthesis, estrogen and glucagon associated signaling pathways. These results revealed that miRNA-122 may be an indispensable biomarker for the diagnosis, prognostic evaluation and targeted therapy in pan-cancer."

First, we reviewed the prescription of aldosterone antagonists among 408 patients presenting to the cardiology clinic at a major hospital in Jordan. Second, physicians and pharmacists working in cardiovascular departments completed a questionnaire related to use of aldosterone antagonists in HF and post-MI. Thirty patients (7.59%) were eligible for aldosterone antagonist; only 4 received them at discharge (13.3%). The survey was completed by 153 professionals (response rate 76.12%). About 72.1% of participants were aware of studies regarding use of aldosterone antagonists post-MI and in HF. Moreover, 10.45%/53.6% of participants strongly agreed/agreed that these agents are useful in normotensive post-MI and HF patients. Spironolactone was the most prescribed drug by 92.1% of participants. About 41.8% of participants reported use of spironolactone in post-MI and HF. With respect to guidelines, only 39.2% of participants agreed that adding spironolactone to standard therapy in HF is recommended, and 48.3% agreed on adding it directly post-MI. Clinical pharmacists and cardiologists were generally more aware of guidelines than pharmacists, cardiac surgeons and residents/fellows. there is an under-use of aldosterone antagonists in HF and post-MI patients, and a lack of detailed awareness of current guidelines among health care providers. Dissemination of evidence-based guidelines and usage protocols may improve management of post-MI and HF."

        "abstract": "Although minimalist footwear is increasingly popular among runners, claims that minimalist footwear enhances running biomechanics and efficiency are controversial. Minimalist and barefoot conditions improve running efficiency when compared with traditional running shoes. Randomized crossover trial. Level 3. Fifteen experienced runners each completed three 90-second running trials on a treadmill, each trial performed in a different type of footwear: traditional running shoes with a heavily cushioned heel, minimalist running shoes with minimal heel cushioning, and barefoot (socked). High-speed photography was used to determine foot strike, ground contact time, knee angle, and stride cadence with each footwear type. Runners had more rearfoot strikes in traditional shoes (87%) compared with minimalist shoes (67%) and socked (40%) ( P = 0.03). Ground contact time was longest in traditional shoes (265.9 \u00b1 10.9 ms) when compared with minimalist shoes (253.4 \u00b1 11.2 ms) and socked (250.6 \u00b1 16.2 ms) ( P = 0.005). There was no difference between groups with respect to knee angle ( P = 0.37) or stride cadence ( P = 0.20). When comparing running socked to running with minimalist running shoes, there were no differences in measures of running efficiency. When compared with running in traditional, cushioned shoes, both barefoot (socked) running and minimalist running shoes produce greater running efficiency in some experienced runners, with a greater tendency toward a midfoot or forefoot strike and a shorter ground contact time. Minimalist shoes closely approximate socked running in the 4 measurements performed. With regard to running efficiency and biomechanics, in some runners, barefoot (socked) and minimalist footwear are preferable to traditional running shoes."

Thus, the aim of the present study was to improve the solubility and dissolution rate of PX by freeze drying technique using dimethylformamide (DMF), chloroform and water as co-solvent system. The prepared crystals containing PX were evaluated for DMF and chloroform solvent residual by gas chromatography and solubility and in vitro dissolution. The prepared formulations were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimeter; X-ray diffraction and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Dissolution profile of the freeze dried crystals was compared with its recrystallized and pure samples. The samples were stored in stability chamber to investigate their physical stability. Solvent residual of DMF and chloroform was found to be within the toxic level. Freeze dried crystals exhibited decreased crystallinity and the solubility and dissolution of the PX crystals were significantly improved compared to its recrystallized and pure samples. In stability test, the release profile of the freeze dried crystals was almost unchanged as compared with the freshly prepared freeze dried crystals stored at 40\u00b0C and 75% relative humidity for 90 days. Hence, this technique can be used for formulation of PX tablets by direct compression with directly compressible tablet excipients."

        "abstract": "Mammals navigate by integrating self-motion signals (\u201cpath integration\u201d) and occasionally fixing on familiar environmental landmarks. The rat hippocampus is a model system of spatial representation in which place cells are thought to integrate both sensory and spatial information from entorhinal cortex. The localized firing fields of hippocampal place cells and entorhinal grid-cells demonstrate a phase relationship with the local theta (6\u201310\u2009Hz) rhythm that may be a temporal signature of path integration. However, encoding self-motion in the phase of theta oscillations requires high temporal precision and is susceptible to idiothetic noise, neuronal variability, and a changing environment. We present a model based on oscillatory interference theory, previously studied in the context of grid cells, in which transient temporal synchronization among a pool of path-integrating theta oscillators produces hippocampal-like place fields. We hypothesize that a spatiotemporally extended sensory interaction with external cues modulates feedback to the theta oscillators. We implement a form of this cue-driven feedback and show that it can retrieve fixed points in the phase code of position. A single cue can smoothly reset oscillator phases to correct for both systematic errors and continuous noise in path integration. Further, simulations in which local and global cues are rotated against each other reveal a phase-code mechanism in which conflicting cue arrangements can reproduce experimentally observed distributions of \u201cpartial remapping\u201d responses. This abstract model demonstrates that phase-code feedback can provide stability to the temporal coding of position during navigation and may contribute to the context-dependence of hippocampal spatial representations. While the anatomical substrates of these processes have not been fully characterized, our findings suggest several signatures that can be evaluated in future experiments."

This was a planned analysis of a double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group trial that demonstrated the superiority of a single-pill combination of T80/H25 versus T80 monotherapy in terms of systolic BP change from baseline to week 7. Subpopulations included older (aged \u2265 65 years) versus younger, gender, race, hypertension severity, and prior antihypertensive therapy. Endpoints were change from baseline in mean seated trough cuff systolic and diastolic BP, proportion of patients achieving their BP goal (systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mmHg), and proportion of patients attaining systolic BP reductions of >30 mmHg and >40 mmHg. Across all subgroups, the T80/H25 single-pill combination provided consistently greater systolic and diastolic BP reductions than T80 and more patients had systolic BP reductions of >30 mmHg. In the T80 and T80/H25 groups, BP control was achieved in 34.1% and 48.8% of men, 35.5% and 62.7% of women, 34.5% and 56.6% of Asians, 22.6% and 38.6% of blacks, 36.7% and 57.8% of whites, 36.9% and 57.5% of patients < 65 years, 29.3% and 49.3% \u226565 years, 44.2% and 66.2% of those with grade 2 hypertension, 20.4% and 39.4% of those with grade 3 hypertension, 38.9% and 53.2% of previously untreated patients, 38.1% and 62.5% of patients previously treated with one antihypertensive, and 29.7% and 48.9% of patients previously treated with two or more antihypertensive agents respectively. Treatment was generally well tolerated across the patient subgroups. The T80/H25 single-pill combination provides consistent BP reductions and higher goal attainment rates versus T80 across a range of hypertensive patient subgroups, which are likely to have a positive impact on patients\u2019 cardiovascular risk."

The inhibition of monoamine reuptake is a mechanism of action for the analgesia of nefopam. The spinal cord is an important site for the action of monoamines however, the antinociceptive effect of intrathecal nefopam was not clear. This study was performed to examine the antinociceptive effect of intrathecal (i.t.) nefopam and the pattern of pharmacologic interaction with i.t. morphine in the formalin test. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with an i.t. catheter, and were randomly treated with a vehicle, nefopam, or morphine. Formalin was injected into the hind-paw 10 min. after an i.t. injection of the above experiment drugs. After obtaining antinociceptive ED 50 of nefopam and morphine, the mixture of nefopam and morphine was tested for the antinociceptive effect in the formalin test at a dose of 1/8, 1/4, 1/2 of ED 50 , or ED 50 of each drug followed by an isobolographic analysis. Intrathecal nefopam significantly reduced the flinching responses in both phases of the formalin test in a dose-dependent manner. Its effect, however, peaked at a dose of 30 \u00b5g in phase 1 (39.8% of control) and 10 \u00b5g during phase 2 (37.6% of control). The isobolograhic analysis indicated an additive interaction of nefopam and morphine during phase 2, and a synergy effect in antinociception during phase 1. This study demonstrated that i.t. nefopam produces an antinociceptive effect in formalin induced pain behavior during both phases of the formalin test, while interacting differently with i.t. morphine, synergistically during phase 1, and additively during phase 2."

        "abstract": "Resistant hypertension (RHTN) is an increasingly common clinical problem that is often heterogeneous in etiology, risk factors, and comorbidities. It is defined as uncontrolled blood pressure on optimal doses of three antihypertensive agents, ideally one being a diuretic. The definition also includes controlled hypertension with use of four or more antihypertensive agents. Recent observational studies have advanced the characterization of patients with RHTN. Patients with RHTN have higher rates of cardiovascular events and mortality compared with patients with more easily controlled hypertension. Secondary causes of hypertension, including obstructive sleep apnea, primary aldosteronism, renovascular disease, are common in patients with RHTN and often coexist in the same patient. In addition, RHTN is often complicated by metabolic abnormalities. Patients with RHTN require a thorough evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and optimize treatment, which typically includes a combination of lifestyle adjustments, and pharmacologic and interventional treatment. Combination therapy including a diuretic, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a beta blocker, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist where warranted is the classic regimen for patients with treatment-resistant hypertension. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists like spironolactone or eplerenone have been shown to be efficacious in patients with RHTN, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and primary aldosteronism. Novel interventional therapies, including baroreflex activation and renal denervation, have shown that both of these methods may be used to lower blood pressure safely, thereby providing exciting and promising new options to treat RHTN.

        "abstract": "The novel coronavirus which first emerged in Wuhan, China has affected many sectors of the global economy particularly, the tourism sector. While prior studies have explored how pandemics and crisis in the tourism sector can be managed, only a few have tackled how the tourism industry, especially in developing countries can be restructured to withstand shocks and remain resilient in the face of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic in the future. This article sheds light on the socio-economic and ecological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the eco-tourism sector of Ghana's Savannah region while offering short and long term strategies for building resilience to withstand shocks. Between September and October 2020, data was collected in the tourism enclave of the Savannah region in Ghana using focus group discussions and interviews. Results show that the major socio-economic impact of the pandemic was the loss of livelihoods. Ecological impacts were however mixed \u2013 both positive and negative. The study concludes that socio-economic impacts have been severe because they are closely tied to tourism. The study therefore recommends that immediate measures including stimulus packages be offered to local enterprises affected by the pandemic. In the long term, efforts should be made to diversify the local economy and promote domestic tourism in the country.

The present study is an attempt to make an assessment and characterise the coming years in terms of solar activity and space radiation environment especially due to the abundance of highly energetic heavy ions (known as HZE charged particles). These HZE particle fluxes constitute a major hazard to the astronauts and also to the critical electronic components of the spacecraft. Recent data on the HZE species (from B to Ni) obtained from ACE spacecraft shows a clear enhancement of the particle fluxes between the solar cycle 23 and solar cycle 24 (~between SSN peaks 2002 and 2014) due to the persisting low sunspot numbers of the latter cycle. The peak values of these cosmic ray fluxes occur with a time lag of about a year of the corresponding minimum value of the sunspots of a particular 11-year cycle which is pseudo-periodic in nature. This is demonstrated by the Fourier and Wavelet transform analyses of the long duration (1700\u20132018) yearly mean sunspot number data. The same time series data is also used to train a Hybrid Regression Neural Network (HRNN) model to generate the predicted yearly mean sunspot numbers for the solar cycle 25 (~2019\u20132031). The wavelet analysis of this new series of annual sunspot numbers including the predictions up to the end of 2031 shows a clear trend of continuation of the low solar activity and hence continuation of very high HZE fluxes prevailing in Solar cycle 24 into the solar cycle 25 and perhaps beyond.

Social support has been widely linked to this unique ability to overcome the challenges of raising a child with special needs. In spite of this, there is still paucity of research about the influence of the sources of perceived social support on this ability, known as resilience. This study examined three sources of perceived social support\u2014family, friends and significant other\u2014on the resilience of Ghanaian parents raising children with special needs while adjusting for covariates (parental gender, marital status and educational level). One hundred and seven (107) biological parents were recruited from special schools and parents support groups in Accra, Ghana. They completed paper-and-pencil or online questionnaires on resilience and perceived social support. Output from hierarchical multiple regression after adjusting for covariates showed that only support from significant others predicted resilience. Additionally, being married was positively and holding a higher education was inversely associated with resilience. These findings indicate the importance of support from significant others in the resiliency of parents but underscore the need to fully integrate and emphasize support from the other sources in resilience enhancing interventions.

        "abstract": "Early childhood caries (ECC) is a significant worldwide oral health problem. However, parents do not take their children to the dentist for regular screening of oral diseases as early as they do with pediatricians and family physicians. As a result, pediatricians and family physicians are considered as a reliable and perfect source for children\u2019s oral health promotion and disease prevention. Studies assessing pediatricians\u2019 and family physicians\u2019 practice, knowledge and attitude regarding ECC and infant\u2019s oral health in Saudi Arabia are few. As a result, this study aimed to assess these aspects. A cross-sectional study based on a structured close-ended questionnaire was conveniently distributed among pediatricians and family physicians in Riyadh city, Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire composed of two main sections; demographic characteristics and questions assessing participants\u2019 practice, knowledge and attitude. The data was analyzed using SAS software, frequency and chi-square test were conducted, and P-value of <0.05 and less was considered significant. There was a discrepancy between the participants\u2019 knowledge, attitude and practice. The participants\u2019 practice was lower (42.6%) compared with their attitude (86.1%) and knowledge (65.3%). Most of the participants (52.5%) indicated lack of clinical time was the main barrier for performing oral health related activities. Majority of the participants (76.7%) indicated that they need more dental training and education. Dental caries preventive methods (44.6%) was the most requested topic, of which workshops and seminars were the main preferred method (39.6%). Although most of the participants reported good dental attitude and knowledge, a lack of the associated dental practice was detected. Therefore, more efforts are encouraged to enhance and facilitate dental practice among pediatricians and family physicians."

Seventy-five women with breast cancer underwent DCE-MRI before and after NAC. Lesions were assessed by ELV, response evaluation criteria in solid tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), and total lesion volume (TLV). The diagnostic and pathological predictive performances of the methods were compared and color maps were compared with pathological results. ELV identified 29%, 67%, and 4% of cases with partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease, respectively. There was no significant difference in evaluation performances among the methods. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of ELV for predicting pathologic response were 72%, 92%, 81.8%, 86.8%, and 85.3%, respectively, with the highest sensitivity, NPV, and accuracy of the three methods. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was also highest for ELV. Pre- and post-NAC color maps reflecting tumor activity were consistent with pathological necrosis. ELV may help evaluate the responsiveness of breast cancer patients to NAC, and may provide a good tumor-response indicator through the ability to indicate tumor viability."

Though glioma patients receive active treatment, the survival rate is still poor. Therefore, it is urgent to discover a new medicine to treat glioma patients in order to improve the survival rate. In this study, we explored the anticancer effect and the potential mechanism of luteolin on glioma in vitro. Cell viability was determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry analysis were used to determine the cellular apoptosis. Western blot analysis was performed to explore the changes in protein expression. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was utilized to evaluate the expression level of the tumor suppressor miR-124-3p. CCK-8 assays indicated that luteolin significantly inhibited glioma cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry analysis confirmed that luteolin induced glioma cell apoptosis. Western blot analysis showed that luteolin induced cellular apoptosis in glioma cells via MAPK activation (JNK, ERK, and p38). Luteolin stimulated the death receptor (FADD) to regulate the apoptosis proteins (Caspase-8, Caspase-3, and PARP). Luteolin increased the expression levels of LC3B II/I and downregulated the level of p62 that promotes cell autophagy. Finally, qRT-PCR confirmed that luteolin upregulated the expression levels of miR-124-3p. These findings illustrate that luteolin may be a potential drug for glioma treatment."

A total of 300, 1-d-old healthy broiler chickens were randomly divided into five treatment groups: i) basal diet (control), ii) basal diet+0.25% yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) (YC), iii) basal diet+0.25% yeast with bacteriocin (BA), iv) basal diet+ Lactobacillus cultures (LAB), and v) basal diet +0.25% yeast with bacteriocin+ Lactobacillus cultures (BA+LAB). Growth performance, cecal microbiota, cecal fermentation products, and blood biochemistry parameters were determined when chickens were 21 and 35 d old. The supplementation of YC, BA, and BA+LAB resulted in a significantly better feed conversion rate (FCR) than that of the control group during 1 to 21 d (p<0.05). The LAB supplementation had a significant effect on the presence of Lactobacillus in the ceca at 35 d. None of the supplements had an effect on relative numbers of L. agilis and L. reuter at 21 d, but the BA supplementation resulted in the decrease of both Lactobacillus strains at 35 d. The BA+LAB supplementation resulted in higher short chain fatty acid (SCFA) in the ceca, but LAB supplementation significantly decreased the SCFA at 35 d (p<0.05). All treatments tended to decrease ammonia concentration in the ceca at 21 d, especially in the LAB treatment group. The BA supplementation alone decreased the triacylglycerol (TG) concentration significantly at 21 d (p<0.05), but the synergistic effect of BA and LAB supplementation was required to reduce the TG concentration at 35 d. The YC supplementation tended to increase the plasma cholesterol at 21 d and 35 d. However, the BA supplementation significantly decreased the cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol level at 35 d. In conclusion, the BA+LAB supplementation was beneficial to body weight gain and FCR of broiler chickens. The effect of BA and LAB supplementation may be a result of the growth of lactic acid bacteria enhancement and physiological characterization of bacteriocin, and it suggests that the BA and LAB supplementation level or Lactobacillus strain selection should be integrated in future supplementation designs."

Four hierarchical linear regression analyses with the scores of each coping strategy subscale as a dependent variable were performed. High persistence, cooperativeness, self-transcendence, and low harm avoidance were associated with using a problem-focused coping strategy. Being female, high novelty seeking, reward dependence, and self-transcendence were associated with using a support-seeking coping strategy. High novelty seeking, self-transcendence, and low self-directedness were associated with using emotion-focused coping strategy. Being female, high novelty seeking, persistence, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence were associated with using a hopeful-thinking coping strategy. Our results show that there may be specific personality features guiding what kind of coping strategy an individual might use in a given situation."

Understanding the signalling pathways involved may enable the development of effective pharmacological cardioprotection. We investigated the interrelationship between activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) in the signalling mechanisms of TP and developed a potent pharmacological intervention based on this mechanism. Isolated rat hearts were subjected to TP, 30 min global ischaemia, and 60 min reperfusion. Other control and TP hearts were perfused with either sotalol (\u03b2-adrenergic blocker) or H-89 (PKA inhibitor). Some hearts were pre-treated with either isoproterenol (\u03b2-adrenergic agonist) or adenosine (PKC activator) that were given alone, simultaneously, or sequentially. Pre-treatment with isoproterenol, adenosine, and the consecutive isoproterenol/adenosine treatment was also combined with the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine. Cardioprotection was evaluated by haemodynamic function recovery, lactate dehydrogenase release, measurement of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, and protein carbonylation during reperfusion. Cyclic AMP and PKA activity were increased in TP hearts. H-89 and sotalol blocked the cardioprotective effect of TP and TP-induced PKC activation. Isoproterenol, adenosine, and the consecutive treatment increased PKC activity during pre-ischaemia. Isoproterenol significantly reduced myocardial glycogen content. Isoproterenol and adenosine, alone or simultaneously, protected hearts but the consecutive treatment gave the highest protection. Cardioprotective effects of adenosine were completely blocked by chelerythrine but those of the consecutive treatment only attenuated. The signal transduction pathway of TP involves PKA activation that precedes PKC activation. Pharmacologically induced consecutive PKA/PKC activation mimics TP and induces extremely potent cardioprotection."

These clusters are thought to contribute to the detrimental effects of radiation, in part due to the compromised repair of clustered DNA damaged sites. The repair of three-lesion cluster present in oligonucleotides were determined in vitro using the hamster cell line CHO-K1 nuclear extract or purified proteins involved in base excision repair. The mutagenic potential of these clusters present in a plasmid was determined using an Escherichia coli reporter assay. We have shown that the repair of an abasic (AP) site within a three-lesion cluster, comprised of an AP site and bi-stranded 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) lesions, is retarded compared to that of an isolated AP site in an in vitro base excision repair (BER) assay. Further, the mutation frequency of the clustered damaged site is up to three times greater than that of an isolated 8-oxoG lesion. As a consequence of enhanced mutagenic potential of clusters, non-double-strand break (DSB) DNA damage may contribute to the detrimental effects of radiation, in addition to the effects of DSB."

        "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several loci associated with schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder. We performed a GWAS of psychosis as a broad syndrome rather than within specific diagnostic categories. 1239 cases with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychotic bipolar disorder; 857 of their unaffected relatives, and 2739 healthy controls were genotyped with the Affymetrix 6.0 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Analyses of 695,193 SNPs were conducted using UNPHASED, which combines information across families and unrelated individuals. We attempted to replicate signals found in 23 genomic regions using existing data on nonoverlapping samples from the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium and Schizophrenia-GENE-plus cohorts (10,352 schizophrenia patients and 24,474 controls). No individual SNP showed compelling evidence for association with psychosis in our data. However, we observed a trend for association with same risk alleles at loci previously associated with schizophrenia (one-sided p = .003). A polygenic score analysis found that the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium\u2019s panel of SNPs associated with schizophrenia significantly predicted disease status in our sample ( p = 5 \u00d7 10 \u201314 ) and explained approximately 2% of the phenotypic variance. Although narrowly defined phenotypes have their advantages, we believe new loci may also be discovered through meta-analysis across broad phenotypes. The novel statistical methodology we introduced to model effect size heterogeneity between studies should help future GWAS that combine association evidence from related phenotypes. Applying these approaches, we highlight three loci that warrant further investigation. We found that SNPs conveying risk for schizophrenia are also predictive of disease status in our data."

There is evidence that the sport-specific training in these sports may affect the development of VJ throughout the developmental years. Thus, the main objective of this study was to investigate the sport-related effect (volleyball, basketball, soccer) on vertical jumping ability (VJ) and on the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) during puberty. 320 boys (12\u201315 years old) \u2013 80 basketball players (BP), 80 soccer players (SP), 80 volleyball players (VP) and 80 non-athletes (NA) \u2013 participated in the present study. VJ was evaluated by the squat jump (SJ) and countermovement jump (CMJ) tests, and the contribution of SSC was calculated. The SJ and CMJ were significantly higher in VP vs. NA at the age of 12 years old and significantly greater in all sports vs. NA at the age of 13, 14 and 15 years. Furthermore, 15-year-old VP demonstrated significantly higher SJ and CMJ compared with BP and SP (p<0.01), whereas no differences were observed between BP and SP (p>0.05). Finally, pairwise comparisons revealed non-significant sport- and age-related differences (p > .05) in SSC. The pattern of age-related increase in VJ is different between athletes and non-athletes during puberty. Furthermore, sport-specific training adaptations are evident at the age of 15 years old where VP demonstrate greater VJ than BP and SP, while in younger age groups, there are no significant differences in VJ between athletes of different sports."

Certain tumor associated p53 missense mutants acquire gain-of-function (GOF) properties and confer oncogenic phenotypes including enhanced chemoresistance. The colorectal cancers (CRC) harboring mutant p53 are generally aggressive in nature and difficult to treat. To identify a potential gene expression signature of GOF mutant p53-driven acquired chemoresistance in CRC, we performed transcriptome profiling of floxuridine (FUdR) treated SW480 cells expressing mutant p53 R273H (GEO#: GSE77533 ). We obtained several genes differentially regulated between FUdR treated and untreated cells. Further, functional characterization and pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment of crucial biological processes and pathways upon FUdR treatment in SW480 cells. Our data suggest that in response to chemotherapeutics treatment, cancer cells with GOF mutant p53 can modulate key cellular pathways to withstand the cytotoxic effect of the drugs. The genes and pathways identified in the present study can be further validated and targeted for better chemotherapy response in colorectal cancer patients harboring mutant p53."

Available scientific articles published in PubMed and Scopus literature databases, scientific reports and manufacturers\u2019 instructions and product information from internet websites, written in English, using following search terms: \u201cacid etching, ceramic surface treatment, hydrofluoric acid, acidulated phosphate fluoride, ammonium hydrogen bifluoride\u201d, have been reviewed. There are several acids with fluoride ion in their composition that can be used as ceramic surface etchants. The etching effect depends on the acid type and its concentration, etching time, as well as ceramic type. The most effective etching pattern is achieved when using hydrofluoric acid; the numerous micropores and channels of different sizes, honeycomb-like appearance, extruded crystals or scattered irregular ceramic particles, depending on the ceramic type, have been detected on the etched surfaces. Acid etching of the bonding surface of glass - ceramic restorations is considered as the most effective treatment method that provides a reliable bond with composite cement. Selective removing of the glassy matrix of silicate ceramics results in a micromorphological three-dimensional porous surface that allows micromechanical interlocking of the luting composite."

Large body of evidence exist to strengthen the prognostic role of endoscopic evaluation for both disease activity and severity and it remains the gold standard for the assessment of mucosal healing. Mucosal healing has been associated with improved clinical outcomes with prolonged remission, decreased hospitalization, IBD-related surgeries and colorectal cancer risk. Therefore, endoscopic objectives in IBD have been incorporated as part of standard care. With the known increased risk of colorectal cancer in IBD, although prevention strategies continue to develop, regular surveillance for early detection of neoplasia continue to be paramount in IBD patients\u2019 care. It is thanks to evolving technology and visualization techniques that surveillance strategies are continuously advancing. Therapeutic endoscopic options in IBD have also been expanding, from surgery sparing therapies such as balloon dilation of fibrostenotic strictures in CD to endoscopic mucosal resection of neoplastic lesions. In this review article, we discuss the current evidence on the use of endoscopy as part of standard of care of IBD, its role in surveillance of neoplasia, and the role of interventional endoscopic therapies."

        "abstract": "This paper analyzes the urban-rural land-use change of Chongqing and its policy dimensional driving forces from 1995 to 2006, using high-resolution Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) data of 1995, 2000 and 2006, and socio-economic data from both research institutes and government departments. The outcomes indicated that urban-rural land-use change in Chongqing can be characterized by two major trends: First, the non-agricultural land increased substantially from 1995 to 2006, thus causing agricultural land especially farmland to decrease continuously. Second, the aggregation index of urban settlements and rural settlements shows that local urban-rural development experienced a process of changing from aggregation (1995-2000) to decentralization (2000-2006). Chongqing is a special area getting immersed in many important policies, which include the establishment of the municipality directly under the Central Government, the building of Three Gorges Dam Project, the Western China Development Program and the Grain-for-Green Programme, and bring about tremendous influences on its land-use change. By analyzing Chongqing's land-use change and its policy driving forces, some implications for its new policy of \u2018Urban-rural Integrated Reform\u2019 are obtained. That is more attentions need to be paid to curbing excessive and idle rural housing and consolidating rural construction land, and to laying out a scientific land-use plan for its rural areas taking such rural land-use issues as farmland occupation and rural housing land management into accounts, so as to coordinate and balance the urban-rural development."

        "abstract": "Based on the microRNA (miRNA) signature of bladder cancer (BC) by deep sequencing, we recently found that several double-stranded mature miRNAs derived from the same pre-miRNAs were sufficiently expressed and acted as tumour suppressors by regulating common target genes in BC. Our deep-sequencing signature of BC showed that all miR-199 family members ( miR-199a-3p/-5p and miR-199b-3p/-5p ) were also downregulated. We hypothesised that these miRNAs may function as tumour suppressors by regulating common target genes. Functional assays of BC cells were performed using transfection of mature miRNA. In silico analyses and luciferase reporter analyses were applied to identify target genes of these miRNAs. The overall survival of patients with BC in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was evaluated by the Kaplan\u2013Meier method. Restoration of these miRNAs significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in BC cells. Integrin \u03b1 3 ( ITGA3 ) was directly regulated by these miRNAs. The Cancer Genome Atlas database showed that patients with low pre-miR-199 family ( miR-199a-1/-2 and miR-199b ) expression exhibited significantly poorer overall survival compared with patients with high pre-miR-199 family expression. miR-199 family miRNAs functioned as tumour suppressors in BC cells by targeting ITGA3 and might be good prognostic markers for predicting survival in patients with BC."

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a deleterious impact on the CV risk factors, with an increase in both sedentary and unhealthy food habits. The fear of contagion has decreased the access to the emergency systems with an increase in out-of-hospital-cardiac-arrests and late presentation of acute myocardial infarctions. The closure of the non-urgent services has delayed cardiac rehabilitation programmes and chronic clinical care. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic impact on the population habits and on the management of CVDs, we will probably face an increase in CVD and heart failure cases. It is crucial to use all the non-traditional approaches, such as telemonitoring systems, in order to overcome the difficulties raised by the pandemic."

        "abstract": "Nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as quinoline, quinazolinones and indole are scaffolds of natural products and have broad biological effects. During the last years those structures have been intensively synthesized and modified to yield new synthetic molecules that can specifically inhibit the activity of dysregulated protein kinases in cancer cells. Herein, a series of newly synthesized isoquinolinamine (FX-1 to 8) and isoindoloquinazolinone (FX-9, FX-42, FX-43) compounds were evaluated in regards to their anti-leukemic potential on human B- and T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Several biological effects were observed. B-ALL cells (SEM, RS4;11) were more sensitive against isoquinolinamine compounds than T-ALL cells (Jurkat, CEM). In SEM cells, metabolic activity decreased with 10 \u03bcM up to 26.7% (FX-3), 25.2% (FX-7) and 14.5% (FX-8). The 3-(p-Tolyl) isoquinolin-1-amine FX-9 was the most effective agent against B- and T-ALL cells with IC50 values ranging from 0.54 to 1.94 \u03bcM. None of the tested compounds displayed hemolysis on erythrocytes or cytotoxicity against healthy leukocytes. Anti-proliferative effect of FX-9 was associated with changes in cell morphology and apoptosis induction. Further, influence of FX-9 on PI3K/AKT, MAPK and JAK/STAT signaling was detected but was heterogeneous. Functional inhibition testing of 58 kinases revealed no specific inhibitory activity among cancer-related kinases. In conclusion, FX-9 displays significant antileukemic activity in B- and T-ALL cells and should be further evaluated in regards to the mechanisms of action. Further compounds of the current series might serve as templates for the design of new compounds and as basic structures for modification approaches."

        "abstract": "Accumulating evidence shows that microRNAs are aberrantly expressed and exert essential roles in the tumorigenesis and tumor progression of non\u2010small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The plasma miRNAs from five healthy donors and four NSCLC patients were profiled by miRNA microarray. The differentially expressed miRNAs from 154 primary NSCLC patients and 146 healthy donors were subjected to RNA isolation and verified by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The miRNA microarray analysis revealed that 40 differential miRNAs between NSCLC patients and healthy donors were selected. We found that the plasma miR\u20101247\u20105p, miR\u2010301b\u20103p and miR\u2010105\u20105p levels of patients were significantly higher than those of healthy controls. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses revealed higher area under the ROC curve (AUC) values and higher sensitivity/specificity of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in combination with miR\u20101247\u20105p, miR\u2010301b\u20103p, or miR\u2010105\u20105p were superior to that of CEA alone. High miR\u20101247\u20105p, miR\u2010301b\u20103p and miR\u2010105\u20105p expression have been demonstrated to accelerate tumorigenesis, and these three miRNAs in plasma act as novel biomarkers for the early diagnosis of NSCLC patients. Plasma miR\u20101247\u20105p, miR\u2010301b\u20103p and miR\u2010105\u20105p act as novel biomarkers for early NSCLC and NSCLC.   In summary, our results indicate that miR\u20101247\u20105p, miR\u2010301b\u20103p, and miR\u2010105\u20105p are candidate biomarkers of NSCLC, which perform even better when combined with CEA levels.

The long, complex orf1ab polyproteins of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 play an important role in viral RNA synthesis. To assess the impact of mutations in this important domain, we analyzed 1134 complete protein sequences of orf1ab polyprotein from NCBI Virus database from affected patients across various states of USA from December 2019 to 25 th April 2020. Multiple sequence alignment using Clustal Omega followed by statistical significance was calculated. Four significant mutations T265I (nsp 2), P4715L (nsp 12) and P5828L and Y5865C (both at nsp 13) were identified in important non\u2010structural proteins, which function either as replicase or helicase. A comparative analysis shows 265T\u2192I, 5828P\u2192L and 5865Y\u2192C are unique to USA and not reported from Europe or Asia; while one, 4715P\u2192L is predominant in both Europe and USA. Mutational changes in amino acids are predicted to alter structure and function of corresponding proteins, thereby it is imperative to consider the mutational spectra while designing new antiviral therapeutics targeting viral orf1ab.

        "abstract": "The recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of ocriplasmin for the treatment of symptomatic vitreomacular adhesion (VMA), often associated with vitreomacular traction (VMT) and macular hole (MH), has brought new attention to the field of pharmacologic vitreolysis. The need for an enzyme to split the vitreomacular interface, which is formed by a strong adhesive interaction between the posterior vitreous cortex and the internal limiting membrane, historically stems from pediatric eye surgery. This review summarizes the different anatomic classifications of posterior vitreous detachment or anomalous posterior vitreous detachment and puts these in the context of clinical pathologies commonly observed in clinical practice of the vitreoretinal specialist, such as MH, VMT, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic macular edema. We revisit the outcome of the Phase II studies that indicated ocriplasmin was a safe and effective treatment for selected cases of symptomatic VMA and MH. Release of VMA at day 28 was achieved by 26.5% of patients in the ocriplasmin group versus 10.1% in the placebo group ( P <0.001). Interestingly, for MHs, the numbers were more remarkable. Predictive factors for successful ocriplasmin treatment were identified for VMT (VMA diameter smaller than 1,500 \u03bcm) and MH (smaller than 250 \u03bcm). In comparison with the highly predictable outcome after vitrectomy, the general success rate of ocriplasmin not under clinical trial conditions has not fully met expectations and needs to be proven in real-world clinical settings. The ocriplasmin data will be compared in the future with observational data on spontaneous VMA release, will help retina specialists make more accurate predictions, and will improve outcome rates."

Drug-resistant liver cancer cell lines, such as HepG2/adriamycin (ADR) cells, were treated and screened using adriamycin. Gene interference was used to silence the expression of P4HB in liver cancer cells. Cell viability, invasiveness and migration were assessed using CCK8, Transwell and wound healing assays, respectively. In addition, changes to key genes and proteins in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and \u03b2-catenin/Snail pathway were analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting. Drug-resistant HepG2/ADR cells were successfully cultivated; the IC 50 to ADR for HepG2/ADR and HepG2 cell lines was 4.85 and 0.61 \u00b5M, respectively. HepG2/ADR cells exhibited higher invasion and migration abilities compared with HepG2 cells (P<0.05). E-cadherin mRNA and protein expression levels in HepG2/ADR cells were decreased significantly, whereas P4HB, N-cadherin and vimentin mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased compared with HepG2 cells (all P<0.05). Knockdown of P4HB significantly decreased cell viability and the invasion and migration ability of HepG2/ADR cells. In addition, P4HB knockdown enhanced E-cadherin mRNA and protein expression levels, whereas N-cadherin, vimentin, total \u03b2-catenin, nuclear \u03b2-catenin and Snail mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased (all P<0.05). Overall, the present study demonstrated that EMT and \u03b2-catenin/Snail pathway influence P4HB modulation in liver cancer chemoresistance."

Testing for aeroallergen sensitization should therefore be considered in the evaluation of children with CRS. At present the aeroallergen sensitivity profile of children with CRS remains uncharacterized. In this study, we retrospectively identify a consecutive series of children with CRS and allergic rhinitis who have undergone joint otolaryngology and allergy evaluation at a single tertiary care center. We describe the aeroallergen sensitivity profiles (based upon formal skin testing) of these children, stratifying them according to co-morbidity status: 1) CRS with cystic fibrosis (CF), 2) CRS with immune deficiency and 3) uncomplicated CRS (without co-morbid CF, immune deficiency or primary ciliary dyskinesia). We identify 208 children (average age 9.3 years, standard deviation 4.8 years) with CRS and allergic rhinitis meeting inclusion criteria, 140 with uncomplicated CRS, 64 with co-morbid immune deficiency and 4 with co-morbid CF. The prevalence of indoor aeroallergen sensitivities (62.9\u2013100.0%) was more common than that of outdoor aeroallergen sensitivities (43.8\u201350.0%) in all three cohorts of children. In all three cohorts, the most common indoor aeroallergen sensitivity was to dust mites (50.0\u201375.0%) and the most common outdoor aeroallergen sensitivity was to tree pollens (43.8\u201350.0%). The aeroallergen sensitivity profile of children with CRS and allergic rhinitis appears to be similar to that of the general pediatric population with allergic rhinitis, and parallels the aeroallergen sensitivities previously described for adults with CRS and allergic rhinitis. Knowledge of the aeroallergen sensitivities in children with CRS and allergic rhinitis will enhance both diagnostic and treatment strategies."

Male patients had orchitis, erectile dysfunction, prostatitis, and urethral stricture, while female patients had vaginitis and cervicitis. Some patients had laboratory abnormalities and liver injury. Patients received combination therapy of rifampicin and doxycycline. Doxycycline combined with levofloxacin or moxifloxacin was administered to patients with rifampicin intolerance. All patients had received antibiotic therapy for at least 6 weeks. One patient was lost to follow-up, one patient relapsed because of osteoarthropathy, and one patient had dysuria resulting from chronic prostatitis. The clinical symptoms resolved in the other patients, and the overall patient prognosis was good. Clinicians should pay attention to brucellosis-induced reproductive system damage. The two-drug regimen of rifampicin+doxycycline is recommended for these patients. Doxycycline combined with levofloxacin or moxifloxacin should be used in patients with brucellosis-induced reproductive system damage who have rifampicin intolerance.

In previous studies, ultraviolet-inactivated Sendai virus strain Tianjin (UV-Tianjin) demonstrated antitumor effects on human breast cancer cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro antitumor effects of UV-Tianjin on the human cervical carcinoma HeLa, human small cell lung cancer NCI-H446 and human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep 3B cell lines, and the possible underlying mechanisms of these antitumor effects. A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay revealed that UV-Tianjin treatment inhibited the proliferation of HeLa, NCI-H446 and Hep 3B cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Hoechst and Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double staining indicated that UV-Tianjin induced dose-dependent apoptosis in all three cell lines with the most significant effect observed in the HeLa cell line. In the HeLa cell line, UV-Tianjin-induced apoptosis was further confirmed by the disruption of the mitochondria membrane potential and the activation of caspases, as demonstrated by fluorescent cationic dye and colorimetric assays, respectively. In addition, western blot analysis revealed that UV-Tianjin treatment resulted in significant upregulation of cytochrome c , apoptosis protease activating factor-1, Fas, Fas ligand and Fas-associated protein with death domain, and activated caspase-9, \u22128 and \u22123 in HeLa cells. Based on these results, it is hypothesized that UV-Tianjin exhibits anticancer activity in HeLa, NCI-H446 and Hep 3B cell lines via the induction of apoptosis. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that in the HeLa cell line, intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways may be involved in UV-Tianjin-induced apoptosis."

        "abstract": "The California purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus , is a long-lived echinoderm with a complex and sophisticated innate immune system. There are several large gene families that function in immunity in this species including the Sp185/333 gene family that has \u223c50 (\u00b110) members. The family shows intriguing sequence diversity and encodes a broad array of diverse yet similar proteins. The genes have two exons of which the second encodes the mature protein and has repeats and blocks of sequence called elements . Mosaics of element patterns plus single nucleotide polymorphisms-based variants of the elements result in significant sequence diversity among the genes yet maintains similar structure among the members of the family. Sequence of a bacterial artificial chromosome insert shows a cluster of six, tightly linked Sp185/333 genes that are flanked by GA microsatellites. The sequences between the GA microsatellites in which the Sp185/333 genes and flanking regions are located, are much more similar to each other than are the sequences outside the microsatellites suggesting processes such as gene conversion, recombination, or duplication. However, close linkage does not correspond with greater sequence similarity compared to randomly cloned and sequenced genes that are unlikely to be linked. There are three segmental duplications that are bounded by GAT microsatellites and include three almost identical genes plus flanking regions. RNA editing is detectible throughout the mRNAs based on comparisons to the genes, which, in combination with putative post-translational modifications to the proteins, results in broad arrays of Sp185/333 proteins that differ among individuals. The mature proteins have an N-terminal glycine-rich region, a central RGD motif, and a C-terminal histidine-rich region. The Sp185/333 proteins are localized to the cell surface and are found within vesicles in subsets of polygonal and small phagocytes. The coelomocyte proteome shows full-length and truncated proteins, including some with missense sequence. Current results suggest that both native Sp185/333 proteins and a recombinant protein bind bacteria and are likely important in sea urchin innate immunity."

        "abstract": "The project \u2018Obesogenic Environment and Childhood Obesity\u2019 (OBECHO), carried out under the leadership of the International Institute of Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology (ISLE), has reviewed all sufficiently reported studies of obesogenic environmental determinants published prior to 1 January 2019. Findings of the OBECHO project have formed the unprecedentedly inclusive evidence for policy\u2010making and the establishment of the future research agenda regarding the obesogenic environment. Furthermore, the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) pandemic has made this evidence become an important benchmark record of how youths have interacted with the obesogenic environment in the pre\u2010COVID\u201019 era. The implementation of lockdown measures worldwide for curbing COVID\u201019 transmission has been affecting not mere youth's lifestyle behaviours and weight status but, more fundamentally, obesogenic environments and hence youth\u2010environment interaction patterns. However, COVID\u201019, although causing unfavoured changes, will speed up the transformation of the research landscape from traditional to modern modes for more reliable evidence. We should closely track and study those abnormalities caused by COVID\u201019 and the accompanying interventions."

        "title": "Comparison of Cold Water Sponging and Acetaminophen in Control of Fever Among Children Attending a Tertiary Hospital in South Nigeria",
        "abstract": "A wide range of childhood illnesses are accompanied by fever, leading to varied attempts at treatment by caregivers at home before coming to a hospital. Common modalities of treatment include use of antipyretics and physical methods such as cold water sponging, fanning and removal of clothing. These treatment modalities have been received with varied attitudes among physicians and the scientific community. This study was to assess the efficacy of both modalities in first-line management of fever in our area. The main aim of the study is to compare the effectiveness of cold water sponging with that of oral paracetamol in the treatment of fever in children attending the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Calabar. This is a randomized clinical trial. Eighty-eight children aged 12-120 months who presented to the Children Outpatient Clinic (CHOP) and the Children Emergency Room (CHER) of University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Calabar, with acute febrile illness and axillary temperatures spanning \u2265 38.0-40.0\u00b0C. All children within the age limit whose caregivers gave consent were recruited into the study and were randomized to receive either cold water sponging or oral paracetamol. Axillary temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate and assessment of discomforts (crying, shivering, goose pimples and convulsions) were recorded every 30 min for 2 h. The results were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software and have been presented in the tables. Cold water sponging was very effective in temperature reduction within the first 30 min, with 29 (70.73%) having their temperature reduced to within normal limits. This declined to 12 (29.26%) at 60 min and 4 (10.53%) at 120 min, with the mean temperature differences from the baseline value following the same trends (1.63\u00b0C by 30 min, 0.91\u00b0C by 60 min and 0.39\u00b0C by 120 min). When compared with paracetamol, cold water sponging was more effective in temperature reduction within the first 30 min ( P = 0.000), with the difference in effect at 60 min less significant between these two groups ( P = 0.229). Paracetamol demonstrated a gradual and sustained reduction in temperature with the proportions of afebrile children in this group increasing from 7 (16.27%) at 30 min to 33 (78.57%) at 120 min. The mean temperature differences from the baseline value also showed the same trend. Children who received cold water sponging had more discomforts compared with those who received only oral paracetamol. It is concluded that cold water sponging, although producing rapid reduction in temperature compared with paracetamol, has effects that last only for a short time. Paracetamol on the other hand produces a gradual but sustained effect. The discomforts experienced should not be a limiting factor to the use of cold water sponging in reducing the body temperature of febrile children. Cold water sponging is safe and its use by mothers and primary caregivers should be encouraged while preparing to take the child to the nearest health facility for definitive treatment of the underlying cause of the fever."

We analyzed the prognoses of patients with meningiomas with a rhabdoid or papillary component compared to those of patients with anaplastic meningiomas. From 1994 to June 2013, 14 anaplastic meningiomas, 6 meningiomas with a rhabdoid component, and 5 meningiomas with papillary component were pathologically diagnosed. We analyzed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, extent of removal, adjuvant treatment, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and pathologic features of 14 anaplastic meningiomas (group A), 5 meningiomas with a predominant (\u226550%) papillary or rhabdoid component (group B1), and 6 meningiomas without a predominant (<50%) rhabdoid or papillary component (group B2). Homogeneous enhancement on MRI was associated with improved PFS compared to heterogeneous enhancement ( p =0.025). Depending on pathology, the mean PFS was 134.9\u00b131.6 months for group A, 46.6\u00b113.4 months for group B1, and 118.7\u00b119.2 months for group B2. The mean OS was 138.5\u00b124.6 months for group A and 59.7\u00b116.8 months for group B1. All recurrent tumors were of the previously diagnosed pathology, except for one tumor from group B1, which recurred as an atypical meningioma without a papillary component. Group B1 tumors showed a more aggressive behavior than group B2 tumors. In group B2 cases, the pathologic findings of non-rhabdoid/papillary portion could be considered for further adjuvant treatment."

        "abstract": "Despite growing clinical confidence in generics and their potential to reduce long-term healthcare costs, the transplant community have had real concerns about the use of generic immunosuppressants. One such immunosuppressant is tacrolimus, a cornerstone of lifelong treatment for patients who have undergone a solid organ transplant. Tacrolimus has a narrow therapeutic index (NTI), giving rise to questions about the potential for clinically relevant altered drug exposure. Its use in transplant patients also gives rise to questions about the most discriminative subject population for bioequivalence studies. The recognised need for stringent criteria to support approval of generic drugs with an NTI led the European Medicines Association and Health Canada to provide detailed information on requirements for bioequivalence studies and introduce tighter bioequivalence limits for these drugs, including tacrolimus. The aim of this article is to illustrate how regulatory guidance is implemented during the clinical development of generic immunosuppressants, using a generic, once-daily prolonged-release formulation of tacrolimus as an example."

        "abstract": "Treponema pallidum and HIV are among the most common public health problems in Ethiopia. These infections are interrelated. Treponema pallidum causes genital ulcer which enhances HIV transmission and complicates HIV by causing severe ulcer among HIV-positive individuals. Although Treponema pallidum and HIV have a similar route of transmission, screening services for Treponema pallidum are not available in most of the voluntary counseling and testing centers. This study aimed to assess the seroprevalence of Treponema pallidum and sociodemographic factors among HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals from the voluntary counseling and testing center of St. Paul\u2019s Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. In this research, a cross-sectional study was conducted and a total of 292 consecutive samples were collected from the voluntary counseling and testing center of St. Paul\u2019s Hospital Millennium Medical College. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. A blood specimen was tested for the presence of Treponema pallidum using rapid plasma reagin and a rapid test kit for HIV. The data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20. The overall prevalence of Treponema pallidum was 5/292 (1.7%). All HIV-positive clients were negative for Treponema pallidum . None of the risk factors were significantly associated with Treponema pallidum. In this study, the prevalence of Treponema pallidum was 5/292 (1.7%). None of the study participants were co-infected with Treponema pallidum and HIV. There was a lack of association between syphilis and HIV in this study, but still the prevalence of Treponema pallidum among voluntary counseling and testing center clients is a public health problem. Therefore, Treponema pallidum infection control strategies should be designed in parallel with HIV control strategy and actions should be taken to avert the problem, including the provision of better health education and screening services at voluntary counseling and testing centers parallel with HIV."

The mean cell density (CD), mean coefficient of variation (CV), mean hexagonal cell percentage, mean cell area (AVG), and central corneal thickness (CCT) were evaluated. The mean time from diagnosis of the disease in group 1 was 54.25\u2009\u00b1\u20096.36\u00a0days. The mean time elapsed since the PCR test became negative was 38.45\u2009\u00b1\u20096.87\u00a0days.

In this work, DNA tetrahedron (TD) was constructed and modified with SL2B aptamer (S) and folic acid (F). TD possessed a small diameter (~6 nm) and entered into the nucleus quickly. SL2B aptamer can inhibit cancer cell growth by disturbing vascular endothelial growth factor/Notch signaling pathways. To explore the effect of SL2B number on colorectal cancer inhibition, SL2B multimers (dimer, trimer, and tetramer) were constructed by functionalization of TD with different numbers of SL2B. One SL2B per TD was the most efficient anticancer strategy and showed significantly better anticancer efficacy than SL2B, probably due to the enhanced stability of SL2B by TD. Doxorubicin (DOX) is a potent anticancer agent that can intercalate into DNA double strands. Results showed that TD could facilitate DOX entrance into the nucleus and the intracellular delivery of DOX was further enhanced by functionalization of SL2B and F. DOX-intercalated TD modified with two F and two S (DOX@TD-2F2S) could cause sufficient HT-29 cell inhibition at a much lower DOX concentration. In sum, DOX@TD-2F2S exhibited a synergic anticancer biological effect with chemotherapy and can be a promising strategy for treating colorectal cancer."

To\u00a0better understand the species adaptability of MERS-CoV, we identified a suboptimal species-derived variant of DPP4 to study viral adaption. Passaging virus on cells expressing this DPP4 variant led to accumulation of mutations in the viral spike which increased replication. Parallel passages revealed distinct paths of viral adaptation to the same DPP4 variant. Structural analysis and functional assays showed that these mutations enhanced viral entry with suboptimal DPP4 by altering the surface charge of spike. These findings demonstrate that MERS-CoV spike can utilize multiple paths to rapidly adapt to novel species variation in DPP4. \u2022 MERS-CoV infected cells expressing DPP4 from 16 bat species \u2022 MERS-CoV spike rapidly adapted to species variation in DPP4 \u2022 Viral adaptations modified the surface charge of viral spike \u2022 Different routes of spike adaptation enhanced entry with the same DPP4 variant MERS-CoV infected cells expressing DPP4 from 16 bat species MERS-CoV spike rapidly adapted to species variation in DPP4 Viral adaptations modified the surface charge of viral spike Different routes of spike adaptation enhanced entry with the same DPP4 variant MERS-CoV is a zoonotic pathogen capable of infecting numerous species.

As a traditional Chinese medicine, realgar has been widely used for the treatment of various diseases for >1,500 years. Inspired by nano-drug, realgar nanoparticles (NPs) have been prepared with an average particle size of <100 nm in a previous work. Compared with coarse realgar, the realgar NPs have higher bioavailability. As a principal constituent protein of caveolae, caveolin-1 (Cav-1) participates in regulating various cellular physiological and pathological processes including tumorigenesis and tumor development. In previous studies, it was found that realgar NPs can inhibit several types of tumor cell proliferation. However, the therapeutic effect of realgar NPs on CML has not been fully elucidated. In the present paper, it was demonstrated that realgar NPs can inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells and degrade Bcr-Abl fusion protein effectively. Both apoptosis and autophagy were activated in a dose-dependent manner in realgar NPs treated cells, and the induction of autophagy was associated with class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Morphological analysis indicated that realgar NPs induced differentiation effectively in CML cells. Furthermore, it was identified that Cav-1 might play a crucial role in realgar NP therapy. In order to study the effects of Cav-1 on K562 cells during realgar NP treatment, a Cav-1 overexpression cell model was established by using transient transfection. The results indicated that Cav-1 overexpression inhibited K562 cell proliferation, promoted endogenic autophagy, and increased the sensitivity of K562 cells to realgar NPs. Therefore, the results demonstrated that realgar NPs degraded Bcr-Abl oncoprotein, while the underlying mechanism might be related to apoptosis and autophagy, and Cav-1 might be considered as a potential target for clinical comprehensive therapy of CML."

We sought to determine if defined Bacteroides -based bacteriotherapy could be an effective and consistent alternative to fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in a murine model of IBD. Methods : We induced experimental colitis in 8\u2013 12-week-old C57BL/6 mice using 2\u20133% dextran sodium sulfate. Mice were simultaneously treated by oral gavage with a triple- Bacteroides cocktail, individual Bacteroides strains, FMT using stool from healthy donor mice, or their own stool as a control. Survival, weight loss and markers of inflammation (histology, serum amyloid A, cytokine production) were correlated to 16S rRNA gene profiling of fecal and mucosal microbiomes. Results : Triple- Bacteroides combination therapy was more protective against weight loss and mortality than traditional FMT therapy. B. ovatus ATCC8483 was more effective than any individual strain, or a combination of strains, in preventing weight loss, decreasing histological damage, dampening inflammatory response, and stimulating epithelial recovery. Irrespective of the treatment group, overall Bacteroides abundance associated with treatment success and decreased cytokine production while the presence of Akkermansia correlated with treatment failure. However, the therapeutic benefit associated with high Bacteroides abundance was negated in the presence of Streptococcus . Conclusions : Bacteroides ovatus monotherapy was more consistent and effective than traditional FMT at ameliorating colitis and stimulating epithelial recovery in a murine model of IBD. Given the tolerability of Bacteroides ovatus ATCC 8483 in an active, on-going human study, this therapy may be repurposed for the management of IBD in a clinically expedient timeline."

A total of 88 weaned pigs (6.94\u00b10.76 kg body weight [BW]; 28 d old) were randomly allotted to 2 dietary treatments (4 pigs/pen; 11 replicates/treatment) in a randomized complete block design (sex as a block). The dietary treatments were a typical nursery diet based on corn and soybean meal (CON) and CON added with 20% of palm kernel expellers (PKE). Pigs were fed for 6 wk using a 3-phase feeding program with declining diet complexity and with phases of 1, 2, and 3 wk, respectively. Blood was collected from randomly selected 2 pigs in each pen before weaning and on d 7 after weaning. Pigs were fed respective dietary treatments containing 0.2% chromic oxide from d 29 to 35 after weaning. Fecal samples were collected from randomly selected 2 pigs in each pen daily for the last 3 days after the 4-d adjustment period. Measurements were growth performances, digestibility of dry matter, nitrogen and energy, white and red blood cell counts, packed cell volume, and incidence of diarrhea. The PKE increased average daily gain (ADG) (246 vs 215 g/d; p = 0.06) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) (470 vs 343 g/d; p<0.05) and decreased gain-to-feed ratio (G:F) (0.522 vs 0.628 g/g; p<0.05) during phase 2 compared with CON, but did not affect growth performance during phase 1 and 3. During overall experimental period, PKE increased ADG (383 vs 362 g/d; p = 0.05) and ADFI (549 vs 496 g/d; p<0.05) compared with CON, but did not affect G:F. However, no differences were found on digestibility of dry matter, nitrogen, and energy between CON and PKE. The PKE reduced frequency of diarrhea (15% vs 25%; p = 0.08) for the first 2 wk after weaning compared with CON. Similarly, PKE decreased white blood cells (8.19 vs 9.56\u00d710 3 /\u03bcL; p = 0.07), red blood cells (2.92 vs 3.25\u00d710 6 /\u03bcL; p = 0.09), and packed cell volume (11.1% vs 12.6%; p = 0.06) on d 7 after weaning compared with CON. In conclusion, addition of 20% palm kernel expellers to nursery diet based on corn and soybean meal had no negative effects on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and blood profiles of weaned pigs."

        "abstract": "Objective: Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) and cognitive bias modification for interpretation (CBM-I) both have demonstrated efficacy in alleviating social anxiety, but how they compare with each other has not been investigated. The present study tested the prediction that both interventions would reduce anxiety relative to a no-intervention comparison condition, but CBM-I would be particularly effective at modifying threat-related cognitive bias under high mental load. Method: Sixty-three primarily Caucasian adults (mean age = 22.7, SD = 5.87; 68.3% female) with high social anxiety, randomly allocated to 3 groups: CBM-I ( n = 21), cCBT ( n = 21), and a no-intervention control group ( n = 21) provided complete data for analysis. Pre- and postintervention (4 sessions lasting 2 weeks, control participants only attended the pre\u2013post sessions) self-report measures of anxiety, depression, attentional control, and threat-related interpretive bias were completed. In addition, interpretive bias under high versus low cognitive load was measured using the Scrambled Sentences Test. Results: Both CBM-I and cCBT groups reported significantly reduced levels of social anxiety, trait anxiety, and depression and improved attentional control, relative to the control group, with no clear superiority of either active intervention. Although both active conditions reduced negative bias on the Scrambled Sentences Test completed under mental load, CBM-I was significantly more effective at doing so. Conclusions: The results suggest that although not differing in therapeutic efficacy, CBM-I and cCBT might differ in the resilience of their effects when under mental load."

The studies were carried out in three stages: 7 days, 6 months and 12 months after surgery in a group of 100 patients after amputation of the lower limb due to complications resulting from type 2 diabetes. The study was performed using standardised instruments: WHOQOL-BREF, the Acceptance of Illness Scale (AIS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain intensity assessment. Pain occurred in the examined patients throughout the study. The greatest intensity of pain was observed in the postoperative period and significantly weakened over time. Pain intensity was significantly associated with worse overall QoL perceived (\u22120.255, p=0.011/-0.283, p=0.005) and QoL scores in the physical and psychological domains at the first and second stage of the study (physical domains \u22120.257, p=0.011/-0.219, p=0.03 and psychological \u22120.22, p=0.029/-0.24/0.018). The intensity of pain negatively correlates with the acceptance of the disease in all three stages of the study, the greater the severity of pain, the lower the acceptance of illness (\u22120.298, p=0.003/-0.326, p=0.001/-0.26, p=0.009). The occurrence of anxiety and depression is highly dependent on the severity of pain, especially at the first and second stage of the study (anxiety 0.203, p=0.045/0.257, p=0.01, depression 0.299, p=0.003/0.253, p=0.012). The stronger the pain, the greater the severity of mood disorders. Pain and its severity are associated with QoL in the patients with complicated diabetic foot syndrome following lower limb amputation. Disease acceptance was lower in patients experiencing more severe pain at all stages of the study. There is an association of pain with the occurrence of anxiety and depression in amputees, especially 6 months after surgery."

The interaction between artificial sweeteners and drugs may affect the drug metabolism in patients with diabetes, cancer, and liver damage, this interaction has not been clarified thus far. Here, we examined the effects of the potential saccharin-drug interaction on the activities of 5 cytochrome P450 (CYPs) in male ICR mice; further, we examined the effects of saccharin (4,000 mg/kg) on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion after pretreatment of mice with saccharin for 7 days and after concomitant administration of bupropion and saccharin. Our results showed saccharin did not have a significant effect on the 5 CYPs in the S9 fractions obtained from the liver of mice. In addition, we observed no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of bupropion between the control group and the groups pretreated with saccharin and that receiving concomitant administration of saccharin. Thus, our results showed that saccharin is safe and the risk of saccharin-drug interaction is very low."

We searched systematically for randomized controlled clinical trials on treatment of RA with different biological response modifiers, followed by a systematic review with meta-analysis. Trials were searched from MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases. The following safety parameters reported in the selected trials were analyzed: number of patients suffering any adverse event (AE), withdrawal due to AEs, serious AE (SAEs), infections, serious infections, infusion reactions, injection site reactions, malignancies, and overall mortality. Undesired effects were estimated using combined relative risks (RR) and number needed to harm (NNH). Heterogeneity was evaluated by Cochrane's Q and I 2 statistics. According to inclusion criteria, a total of 43 trials (20,504 patients) were included in this study. A total number of AEs were found more with abatacept (RR: 1.05, NNH: 21.93). Withdrawal due to AEs was found with all biologicals, highest with anakinra (RR: 3.48, NNH: 15.70). Patients receiving newer tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, golimumab, were more likely to develop SAEs (RR: 2.44, NNH: 12.72) and infection (RR: 1.25, NNH: 10.09), and in certolizumab, serious infections (RR: 2.95, NNH: 37.31) were found more. Infusion reaction develops more with rituximab (RR: 1.52, NNH: 8.47). Etanercept showed the highest risk to develop infusion site reaction (RR: 5.33, NNH: 4.65). Biologicals showed no difference to their control counterparts in malignancy and mortality risk. This meta-analysis helps to clarify some frequently encountered and unanswered safety questions of different biological response modifiers, a new class of drugs, in the clinical care of RA patients."

However, its role in other intracellular signaling pathways remains unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of low concentration of ethanol on different intracellular signaling pathways. For this purpose, HepG2 cells were treated with 1 mM ethanol for 10 min and the phosphorylation state of protein kinases was determined. In addition, the mRNA levels of transcription factors and genes associated with the Fas apoptotic pathway were determined. Our data demonstrated that ethanol-induced phosphorylation of protein kinases modulates both anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic mechanisms in HepG2 cells. Pro-apoptosis resulted mainly from the strong inhibition of the G-protein couple receptor signaling pathway. Moreover, the signal transduction initiated by ethanol-induced protein kinases phosphorylation lead to increased expression of the transcription factors with subsequent expression of genes associated with the Fas apoptotic pathway (Fas receptor, Fas ligand, FADD and caspase 8). These results indicate that low concentration of ethanol exert their effect by predominant activation of pro-apoptotic events that can be divided in two phases. An early phase characterized by a rapid transient effect on protein kinases phosphorylation, after 10 min exposure, with subsequent increased expression of transcription factors for up to 6 hr. This early phase is followed by a second phase associated with increased gene expression that began after 6 hr and persisted for more than 24 hr. This information provided a novel insight into the mechanisms of action of ethanol (1mM) in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells."

        "abstract": "Prior studies have identified smoking as a key driver of socioeconomic disparities in U.S. mortality, but the growing drug epidemic leads us to question whether drug abuse is exacerbating those disparities, particularly for mortality from external causes. We use data from a national survey of midlife Americans to evaluate socioeconomic disparities in all-cause and cause-specific mortality over an 18-year period (1995\u20132013). Then, we use marginal structural modeling to quantify the indirect effects of smoking and alcohol/drug abuse in mediating those disparities. Our results demonstrate that alcohol/drug abuse makes little contribution to socioeconomic disparities in all-cause mortality, probably because the prevalence of substance abuse is low and socioeconomic differences in abuse are small, especially at older ages when most Americans die. Smoking prevalence is much higher than drug/alcohol abuse and socioeconomic differentials in smoking are large and have widened among younger cohorts. Not surprisingly, smoking accounts for the majority (62%) of the socioeconomic disparity in mortality from smoking-related diseases, but smoking also makes a substantial contribution to cardiovascular (38%) and all-cause mortality (34%). Based on the observed cohort patterns of smoking, we predict that smoking will further widen SES disparities in all-cause mortality until at least 2045 for men and even later for women. Although we cannot yet determine the mortality consequences of recent widening of the socioeconomic disparities in drug abuse, social inequalities in mortality are likely to grow even wider over the coming decades as the legacy of smoking and the recent drug epidemic take their toll. \u2022 Alcohol/drug abuse contributes little to socioeconomic disparities in mortality. \u2022 Smoking accounts for a substantial share of socioeconomic disparities in mortality. \u2022 Social differentials in smoking are much larger than for substance abuse. \u2022 The socioeconomic differential in smoking has grown wider among younger cohorts. \u2022 In coming decades, smoking will further widen social inequalities in mortality.

CML responds well to therapy targeting BCR-ABL in the chronic phase but is resistant to treatment when it progresses to the blast phase (BP). This study attempted to address whether arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (Alox12) confers to CML drug resistance. We analyzed the expression of Alox12 using Western blotting, ELISA, and RT-PCR methods. Loss of functional analysis was performed using cellular activity assays on CML and normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Alox12 and 12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) are overexpressed in BP-CML but not HSPCs, and that Alox12-12-HETE axis is regulated by BCR-ABL. The Alox12-12-HETE axis is required for CML. Specific Alox12 inhibitor inhibits colony formation, survival, and self-renewal capacity in BP-CML HSPCs, and to a significantly greater extent than in normal HSPCs. Of note, the Alox12 inhibitor significantly augments dasatinib\u2019s efficacy in BP-CML HSPCs. Mechanism studies show that Alox12 inhibition does not affect activities of essential signaling pathways involved in maintaining stem cell function, such as Wnt, p53, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). In contrast, we show that Alox12 inhibition disrupts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) homeostasis and induces oxidative stress and damage in CML HSPCs and committed cells. Alox12-12-HETE axis is a specific and critical regulator of BP-CML HSPCs functions. Pharmacological inhibition of Alox12 may be useful in BP-CML."

Therefore, the pursuit of natural disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMRDs) remains a top priority in rheumatology. The present study focused on curcumin and its derivatives in the search for new DMRDs. We focused on prominent p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase p38\u03b1 which is a prime regulator of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), a key mediator of rheumatoid arthritis. In the present study, we used the X-ray crystallographic structure of p38\u03b1 for molecular docking simulations and molecular dynamic simulations to study the binding modes of curcumin and its derivatives with the active site of p38\u03b1. The ATP-binding domain was used for evaluating curcumin and its derivatives. Molecular docking simulation results were used to select 4 out of 8 compounds. These 4 compounds were simulated using GROMACS molecular simulation platform; the results generated were subjected to molecular mechanics-Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) calculations. The results showed cyclocurcumin as a potential natural compound for development of a potent DMRD. These data were further supported by inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 release from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human macrophages following cyclocurcumin treatment."

A series of patients with coexisting POP and ERP who underwent laparoscopic ventral rectopexy (LVR) combined with laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LSC) are reported here. Methods: Seven patients underwent LVR and LSC together. Fecal incontinence was assessed by the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI), constipation was assessed by the Constipation Scoring System (CSS), and urinary incontinence was assessed by the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF). Anatomical disorders were assessed by Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) and defecography. Results: The patients' median age was 81 (60-88) years. The median operative time was 380 (282-430) minutes. The median postoperative hospital stay was 3 (1-5) days. There were no postoperative complications. The FISI, CSS, POP-Q, and defecography findings improved postoperatively; however, the ICIQ-SF deteriorated in 2 of 5 patients.

        "abstract": "Endovascular transshepatic access has limitations that can be exacerbated in the posttransplantation setting. Although several techniques are available for portal venous system catheterization, the transsplenic approach offers a direct pathway for accessing the portal venous system, as well as associated varices or shunts, while avoiding potential injury to the liver transplant. The purpose of this report is to present the diagnostic and interventional management of main portal vein occlusion in a 56-year-old female after liver transplantation. Endovascular transsplenic recanalization with stenting and shunt embolization is a viable method for treatment of main portal vein thrombosis in an adult liver transplant recipient."

Creating complex spatial objects from a flat sheet of material using origami folding techniques has attracted attention in science and engineering. In the present work, we use the geometric properties of partially folded zigzag strips to better describe the kinematics of known zigzag/herringbone-base folded sheet metamaterials such as Miura-ori. Inspired by the kinematics of a one\u2013degree of freedom zigzag strip, we introduce a class of cellular folded mechanical metamaterials comprising different scales of zigzag strips. This class of patterns combines origami folding techniques with kirigami. Using analytical and numerical models, we study the key mechanical properties of the folded materials. We show that our class of patterns, by expanding on the design space of Miura-ori, is appropriate for a wide range of applications from mechanical metamaterials to deployable structures at small and large scales. We further show that, depending on the geometry, these materials exhibit either negative or positive in-plane Poisson\u2019s ratios. By introducing a class of zigzag-base materials in the current study, we unify the concept of in-plane Poisson\u2019s ratio for similar materials in the literature and extend it to the class of zigzag-base folded sheet materials."

In the present study for optimizing analgesia using the infiltration technique, we proposed two modifications; first is the preemptive use of high volume infiltration, second is applying three anatomical multilevel infiltrations involving the sensory, motor, and sympathetic innervations consecutively. This prospective study involved 48 patients randomized into two groups. After general anesthesia (GA), the infiltration group (I) received bupivacaine 0.5% 2 mg/kg, lidocaine 5 mg/kg, and epinephrine 5 mcg/mL of the total volume (100 mL per 10 cm of the wound length) as a preemptive infiltration at three levels; subcutaneous, intramuscular, and the deep neural paravertebral levels, timed before skin incision, muscular dissection, and instrumentation consecutively. The control group (C) received normal saline in the same manner. Data were compared by Mann-Whitney, Chi-square, and t -test as suitable. Intraoperatively, the LA infiltration reduced fentanyl, atracurium, isoflurane, nitroglycerine, and propofol consumption. Postoperatively, there was a 41% reduction in morphine consumption, longer time to the first analgesic request, lower VAS, early ambulation, and hospital discharge with high-patient satisfaction. The preemptive, high-volume, multilevel infiltration provided a significant intra and postoperative analgesia in scoliosis surgery."

        "abstract": "The prognosis of patients with glioblastoma remains poor even after various treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Thus, development of new drugs is urgently needed. The mechanisms underlying the cytotoxicity of caffeine in glioma cells are not clearly understood. This study aimed to assess the activities of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and histone acetyltransferase (p300) in RT2 glioma cells treated with caffeine. Cell viability and activity of HDAC1 and p300 in RT2 glioma cells were assayed after treatment with caffeine for 48 hours. Cell viability decreased significantly after treatment with 0.5mM, 1mM, and 2mM caffeine. HDAC1 protein activity decreased significantly with various concentrations of caffeine, whereas the activity of p300 increased significantly. In addition, the viability of RT2 cells remained high, but HDAC1 activity decreased, and p300 activity increased markedly with 0.5mM caffeine treatment. We used microRNA and small interfering RNA (siRNA) to regulate HDAC1 and p300 to further understand the impact on glioblastomas. siRNA downregulated p300 and thus increased the viability of RT2 cells, therefore, caffeine combined with siRNA abolished the efficacy of caffeine, which confirmed that caffeine upregulated p300 and reduced cell viability. We also found increased HDAC1 activity when RT2 cells were treated with a combination of caffeine and miR-449a and thus increased the viability of RT2 cells. Our data suggest that a new strategy, caffeine, could increase glioma cell death by decreasing HDAC1 activity and/or by increasing p300 activity. The changes in HDAC1 and p300 activities appeared to occur earlier than loss of RT2 cells."

Five patients with NSCLC completed the Brief Fatigue Inventory (measuring CRF severity) and the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (measuring symptom severity) before and after thoractomy, and at the end of each week of the 16-week exercise program. Additionally, the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (measuring physical and mental functional status) and the Quality of Life Index (measuring QOL) were completed before and after thoracotomy, after weeks 3, 6, 12, and 16 (the end of the exercise program). Further, the 6-minute walk test (measuring functional capacity) was administered before thoracotomy, prior to the initiation of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, and at the end of the 16-week exercise program, after completion of chemotherapy. Participants had a mean age of 63 years and a mean of five comorbid conditions; the exercise program was initiated within 4 days after hospital discharge. Participants\u2019 CRF severity scores were reduced to mild levels, while the mean number of symptoms decreased from 9 postthoracotomy to 6 after the exercise program, with mean levels of severity and interference decreasing to below prethoracotomy levels. Likewise, participants\u2019 functional status and QOL after completing the exercise program improved to near or above prethoracotomy levels. The home-based, light-intensity exercise program for NSCLC patients receiving and completing adjuvant chemotherapy postthoracotomy showed promising trends in improving CRF severity, other symptom severity, functional status, and QOL. Further testing via a two-arm randomized controlled trial is being conducted."

The prevalence of OS, anxiety and depression among teachers was (100%, 67.5% and 23.2%) respectively. OS, anxiety and depression scores were significantly higher among teachers with an age more than 40 years, female teachers, primary school teachers, those with inadequate salary, higher teaching experience, higher qualifications and higher workload. A significant weak positive correlation was found between OS scores and anxiety and depression scores. This study indicated the need for future researches to address risk factors of OS and mental disorders among Egyptian teachers, and the need of periodical medical evaluation of teachers and medical and psychological support for the identified cases."

We investigated the utility of 18 F\u2010NaF uptake for predicting coronary events and evaluated the combined use of coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography ( CCTA ) and 18 F\u2010NaF PET /CT in coronary artery disease risk assessment. This study included patients with \u22651 coronary atherosclerotic lesion detected on CCTA who underwent 18 F\u2010NaF PET / CT . High\u2010risk plaque on CCTA was defined as plaque with low density (<30\u00a0Hounsfield units) and high remodeling index (>1.1). Focal 18 F\u2010NaF uptake in each lesion was quantified using the maximum tissue:background ratio ( TBR  max ), and maximum TBR  max per patient (M\u2010 TBR  max ) was determined. Thirty\u2010two patients having a total of 112 analyzed lesions were followed for 2\u00a0years after 18 F\u2010NaF PET / CT scan, and 11 experienced coronary events (acute coronary syndrome and/or late coronary revascularization [after 3\u00a0months]). Patients with coronary events had higher M\u2010 TBR  max than those without (1.39\u00b10.18 versus 1.19\u00b10.17, respectively; P =0.0034). The optimal M\u2010 TBR  max cutoff to predict coronary events was 1.28 (area under curve: 0.79). Patients with M\u2010 TBR  max \u22651.28 had a higher risk of earlier coronary events than those with lower M\u2010 TBR  max ( P =0.0062 by log\u2010rank test). In patient\u2010based (n=41) and lesion\u2010based (n=143) analyses of CCTA findings that predicted higher coronary 18 F\u2010NaF uptake, the presence of high\u2010risk plaque was a significant predictor of both M\u2010 TBR  max \u22651.28 and TBR  max \u22651.28.  18 F\u2010NaF PET / CT has the potential to detect high\u2010risk coronary artery disease and individual coronary lesions and to predict future coronary events when combined with CCTA .

        "abstract": "A randomized, blinded clinical study was conducted to evaluate ketofol (Ketamine + Propofol combination) anesthesia in 12 entire male mongrel dogs sedated with either acepromazine (ACP) or medetomidine. Group A (6) dogs were pre-medicated with ACP and Group B (6) dogs with medetomidine. Anesthesia was induced and maintained using ketofol (ketamine and propofol). Routine open pre-scrotal castration was performed. Sedation score and ease of arousal were assessed and recorded. Duration and depth of anesthesia were evaluated using apnea and the absence of palpebral and pedal reflexes, attempts to stand up, and muscle tremors and post-operative pain. Simple statistics were compared using Student t -test and Mann\u2013Whitney test ( p < 0.05). Medetomidine-sedated dogs had higher sedation scores compared to ACP-sedated dogs. Medetomidine-ketofol produced significantly ( p < 0.05) longer duration of anesthesia (24.5 \u00b1 3.1 min) compared to ACP-ketofol (10.0 \u00b1 4.4 min). Sixty-seven percent of dogs anesthetized with ACP-ketofol required top up with ketofol to complete the castration. However, none of the Med-ketofol anesthetized dogs required top up. Med-ketofol produced a more profound depth of anesthesia and smoother recovery from anesthesia compared to ACP-ketofol. Med-ketofol (median score 6) attained better overall post-operative analgesia compared to ACP-ketofol (median score 7), though not statistically significant ( p = 0.25). Although both protocols provided adequate anesthesia for castration, top up was required to complete the operation in more than half of ACP-ketofol anesthetized dogs, making Med-ketofol a better protocol. The study recommends the use of Med-ketofol anesthesia for castration in a dog, and post-operative analgesia to be administered with either protocol, but more so in ACP-ketofol anesthetized dogs undergoing castration."

We address this issue in zebrafish through antisense-based morpholino knockdown of Dnmt3 and Dnmt1. Our data reveal that Dnmt3 is required for proper neurogenesis, and its absence results in profound defects in brain and retina. Interestingly, other organs such as intestine remain unaffected suggesting tissue-specific requirements of Dnmt3. Further, comparison of Dnmt1 knockdown phenotypes with those of Dnmt3 suggested that these two families have distinct functions. Consistent with this idea, Dnmt1 failed to complement Dnmt3 deficiency, and Dnmt3 failed to complement Dnmt1 deficiency. Downstream of Dnmt3 we identify a neurogenesis regulator, lef1 , as a Dnmt3-specific target gene that is demethylated and up-regulated in dnmt3 morphants. Knockdown of lef1 rescued neurogenesis defects resulting from Dnmt3 absence. Mechanistically, we show cooperation between Dnmt3 and an H3K9 methyltransferase G9a in regulating lef1 . Further, like Dnmt1-Suv39h1 cooperativity, Dnmt3 and G9a seemed to function together for tissue-specific development. G9a knockdown, but not Suv39h1 loss, phenocopied dnmt3 morphants and G9a overexpression provided a striking rescue of dnmt3 morphant phenotypes, whereas Suv39h1 overexpression failed, supporting the notion of specific DNMT-histone methyltransferase networks. Consistent with this model, H3K9me3 levels on the lef1 promoter were reduced in both dnmt3 and g9a morphants, and its knockdown rescued neurogenesis defects in g9a morphants. We propose a model wherein specific DNMT-histone methyltransferase networks are utilized to silence critical regulators of cell fate in a tissue-specific manner."

Globally, several vaccines have been produced to be effective against COVID-19. This survey aimed to assess the demand and intent towards the COVID-19 vaccine among the general population in Ethiopia. Also, factors influencing their demand, intention, and willingness to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine were described, which is poorly understood in resource-limited settings. Subjects were 1160 individuals who completed an online questionnaire from February to March 2021. The study used the health belief model (HBM) to evaluate participants\u2019 intention to receive and willingness to pay (WTP) regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Chi-square and binary logistic regression were conducted to identify the prevalence and associated factors of demand and WTP. Multinomial regression was done to examine the intent to receive a vaccine. In total 1116 responses were collected. The results indicated a moderate level of demand and WTP among participants (64.7% and 56.0%, respectively). Further, the researchers examined participants\u2019 readiness towards COVID-19 vaccination, where 46.6% of participants had a definite intent, and close to half of the participants are unsure (32.8%) or unwilling (20.7%) to get vaccinated. Among other factors, items under perceived susceptibility and perceived benefits constructs in the HBM have been associated with participants\u2019 demand, willingness to vaccinate, and WTP. This study demonstrates the usefulness of the HBM model in evaluating the demand, intention, and willingness of participants to pay for COVID-19. Improving public awareness of the vulnerability should be a major point of attention to reduce the barriers, and improve demand and intention for COVID-19. Moreover, public health messages should be tailored to enhance vaccine literacy."

TFM safety, its role and benefit in quantifying the set-up uncertainties in patients undergoing PPRT image-guided radiotherapy were assessed. A total of 45 consecutive PPRT patients underwent transperineal implantation of TFM at the level of vesicourethral anastomosis in the retrovesical tissue prior to intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Prostate bed motion was calculated by measuring the position of the TFM relative to the pelvic bony anatomy on daily cone-beam computed tomography. The stability and visibility of the TFM were assessed in the initial 10 patients. No postoperative complications were recorded. A total of 3,500 images were analysed. The calculated prostate bed motion for bony landmark matching relative to TFM were 2.25 mm in the left-right, 5.89 mm in the superior-inferior, and 6.59 mm in the anterior-posterior directions. A significant 36% reduction in the mean volume of rectum receiving 70 Gy (rV 70 ) was achieved for a uniform planning target volume (PTV) margin of 7 mm compared with the Australian and New Zealand Faculty of Radiation Oncology Genito-Urinary Group recommended PTV margin of 10 mm. The use of TFM was safe and can potentially eliminate set-up errors associated with bony landmark matching, thereby allowing for tighter PTV margins and a consequent favourable reduction in dose delivered to the bladder and rectum, with potential improvements in toxicities."

Our previous studies indicated that Cd induces p53-dependent apoptosis by inhibiting gene expression of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Ube) 2d family in both human and rat proximal tubular cells. In this study, the effects of Cd on protein expression of p53 and apoptotic signals in the kidney and liver of mice exposed to Cd for 12 months were examined, as well as the effects of Cd on p53 protein levels and gene expression of the Ube2d family in various cell lines. Results showed that in the kidney of mice exposed to 300 ppm Cd for 12 months, there was overaccumulation of p53 proteins in addition to the induction of apoptosis, which was triggered specifically in the proximal tubules. Interestingly, the site of apoptosis was the same as that of p53 accumulation in the proximal tubules. In the liver of mice chronically exposed to Cd, gene expression of the Ube2d family tended to be slightly decreased, together with slight apoptosis without the accumulation of p53 protein. In rat small intestine epithelial (IEC-6) cells, Cd decreased not only the p53 protein level but also gene expression of Ube2d1 , Ube2d2 and Ube2d4 . In human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), Cd did not suppress gene expression of the Ube2d family, but increased the p53 protein level. In human brain astrocytes (HBASTs), Cd only increased gene expression of UBE2D3 . These results suggest that Cd-induced apoptosis through p53 protein is associated with renal toxicity but not hepatic toxicity, and the modification of p53 protein by Cd may vary depending on cell type."

A survey that was designed to understand the post-sophomore fellowship training better was distributed on the listserv of the Program Directors Section of the Association of Pathology Chairs. A review of the literature on post-sophomore fellowship programs is presented in light of the findings from this survey. Many post-sophomore fellowship programs are run similar to a first-year resident experience, although programs show great diversity in curriculum, including some programs that focus on research. Post-sophomore fellowships attract medical students to the area of pathology and tend to end up in academic and research positions. A second survey of program directors served as an opinion poll of challenging issues that affect residency training. From the second opinion poll, most program directors feel that residents can use additional training to improve the outcome of our future pathologists."

        "abstract": "Psoriasis, a common papulo-squamous disorder of the skin, is universal in occurrence and may interfere with the quality of life adversely. Whether extent of the disease has any bearing upon the patients\u2019 psychology has not much been studied in this part of the world. The objective of this hospital-based cross-sectional study was to assess the disease severity objectively using Psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score and the quality of life by Psoriasis quality-of-life questionnaire-12 (PQOL-12) and to draw correlation between them, if any. PASI score denotes an objective method of scoring severity of psoriasis, reflecting not only the body surface area but also erythema, induration and scaling. The PQOL-12 represents a 12-item self-administered, disease-specific psychometric instrument created to specifically assess quality-of-life issues that are more important with psoriasis patients.PASI and PQOL-12 score were calculated in each patient for objectively assessing their disease severity and quality of life. In total, 34 psoriasis patients (16 males, 18 females), of age ranging from 8 to 55 years, were studied. Maximum and minimum PASI scores were 0.8 and 32.8, respectively, whereas maximum and minimum PQOL-12 scores were 4 and 120, respectively. PASI and PQOL-12 values showed minimal positive correlation ( r = +0.422). Disease severity of psoriasis had no direct reflection upon their quality of life. Limited psoriasis on visible area may also have greater impact on mental health."

        "abstract": "The use of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) in dentistry has proven to be useful in the diagnosis and treatment planning of several oral and maxillofacial diseases. The quality of the resulting image is dictated by many factors related to the patient, unit, and operator. In this work, two dental CBCT units, namely Scanora 3D and 3D Accuitomo 80, were assessed and compared in terms of quantitative effective dose delivered to specific locations in a dosimetry phantom. Resolution and contrast were evaluated in only 3D Accuitomo 80 using special quality assurance phantoms. Scanora 3D, with less radiation time, showed less dosing values compared to 3D Accuitomo 80 (mean 0.33 mSv, SD\u00b10.16 vs. 0.18 mSv, SD\u00b10.1). Using paired t -test, no significant difference was found in Accuitomo two scan sessions ( p >0.05), while it was highly significant in Scanora ( p >0.05). The modulation transfer function value (at 2 lp/mm), in both measurements, was found to be 4.4%. The contrast assessment of 3D Accuitomo 80 in the two measurements showed few differences, for example, the grayscale values were the same (SD=0) while the noise level was slightly different (SD=0 and 0.67, respectively). The radiation dose values in these two CBCT units are significantly less than those encountered in systemic CT scans. However, the dose seems to be affected more by changing the field of view rather than the voltage or amperage. The low doses were at the expense of the image quality produced, which was still acceptable. Although the spatial resolution and contrast were inferior to the medical images produced in systemic CT units, the present results recommend adopting CBCTs in maxillofacial imaging because of low radiation dose and adequate image quality."

Formal-order analysis (FOA) was used to study the similarity of the genome (chromosome and plasmid) of this strain with the genomes from other strains. Chromosomes from ten C.\u00a0burnetii strains and eight plasmids were studied with FOA tools such as \u2018Map of genes\u2019 and \u2018Matrix of similarity.\u2019 The \u2018Map of genes\u2019 tool showed that the chromosome of strain C.\u00a0burnetii str.

The \u2018Matrix of similarity\u2019 was used for an advanced analysis of the obtained results. The complete similarity of the components of chromosomes and plasmids was determined by pairwise comparison and the identification of nucleotides matching with them. A total of 84.90% of the chromosomal components of C.\u00a0burnetii strain NL3262 coincided completely with the chromosomal components of strain Z3055. For chromosomes of other strains, this percentage varied from 12.06% to 47.14%. The plasmid of strain NL3262 had 50.0% of the components being completely coincident with the components of the plasmid of RSA 331; with RSA 493 it was 29.89%. Thus, C.\u00a0burnetii str. NL3262 is the closest to str. Z3055 by the similarity of the chromosomal components, but on the index of average remoteness of the chromosome and the similarity of the plasmids' QpH1 components, it is the closest to strain RSA 331."

Right suborbital nerve was ligated in ION-CCI group to establish a trigeminal neuralgia model. In sham group, suborbital nerve was exposed without ligation. Pain thresholds were measured before surgery and 1, 7, 15, and 30\u2009days after surgery ( n =\u200910). Morris water maze tests ( n =\u200910) were conducted at 1, 15, and 30\u2009days after surgery to evaluate the changes in learning and memory ability of rats. At 5, 19, and 34\u2009days after surgery, serum S100\u03b2 protein concentration and hippocampal A\u03b21-42 protein expression were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; total tau protein expression was detected by Western blotting; changes of neurons in hippocampus were observed by Nissl staining; and the expression of ser404 p-tau, cluster of differentiation (CD)95, CD95L, and cleaved caspase-3 proteins was detected by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Hyperalgesia occurred in ION-CCI group, and mechanical pain threshold decreased significantly ( P <\u20090.05). On the 15th and 30th days after surgery, ION-CCI group showed lower learning and memory ability than sham group ( P <\u20090.05). Serum S100\u03b2 protein concentration, hippocampal A \u03b21-42, and ser404 p-tau protein expression increased in the ION-CCI group 19 and 34\u2009days after surgery ( P <\u20090.05), hippocampal CD95 expression increased in the ION-CCI group after surgery ( P <\u20090.05), hippocampal CD95L expression increased at 19 and 34\u2009days after surgery ( P <\u20090.05), and cleaved caspase-3 expression increased at 5 and 19\u2009days after surgery ( P <\u20090.05).

We also delivered the human follistatin gene, which has the potential to increase therapeutic benefit. After intramuscular injection of DNA, electroporation was applied to enhance delivery to muscle fibers. When plasmids encoding the human calpain3 or dysferlin cDNA sequences were injected into quadriceps muscles of LGMD2A and LGMD2B mouse models, respectively, in 3-month studies, robust levels of calpain3 and dysferlin proteins were detected. We observed a statistically significant decrease in Evans blue dye penetration in LGMD2B mouse muscles after delivery of the dysferlin gene, consistent with repair of the muscle membrane defect in these mice. The therapeutic value of delivery of the genes for alpha-sarcoglycan and follistatin was documented by significant drops in Evans blue dye penetration in gastrocnemius muscles of LGMD2D mice. These results indicated for\u00a0the first time that a combined gene therapy involving both alpha-sarcoglycan and follistatin would be valuable for LGMD2D patients. We suggest that this non-viral gene delivery method should be explored for its translational potential in patients."

Although calculation of loads applied on an orthosis coefficients achieved from calibration is a standard way, most of researchers determined the loads based on available equations. Therefore, the aim of this research is finding the accuracy of this method with respect to calibration. Some strain gauges were attached on the lateral bar of a reciprocal gait orthosis. It was calibrated for axial force and the anteroposterior and mediolateral moments. The outputs of strain gauge were changed to force, and moments based on the coefficients were achieved from calibration using available equations, while 5 normal subjects were walking with the orthosis. There was a significant difference between the force and moments exerted on the orthosis during walking based on the two methods (mostly extension moment and compression force). The results of this research indicated that the output of strain gauge varies based on the methods of calculation. As calibration the gauge is a standard method, it is recommended to calibrate it before use."

One-hundred seventy-eight patients who had cT3/4 tumors were given 5,040 cGy preoperative radiation with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin chemotherapy. A total mesorectal excision was performed 4-6 weeks after preop-CRT. TRG was defined as follows: grade 1 as no cancer cells remaining; grade 2 as cancer cells outgrown by fibrosis; grade 3 as a minimal presence or absence of regression. The prognostic significance of TRG in comparison with histopathologic staging was analyzed. Seventeen patients (9.6%) showed TRG1. TRG was found to be significantly associated with cancer-specific survival (CSS; P = 0.001) and local recurrence (P = 0.039) in the univariate study, but not in the multivariate analysis. The ypN stage was the strongest prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis. Subgroup analysis revealed TRG to be an independent prognostic factor for the CSS of ypN0 patients (P = 0.031). TRG had a stronger impact on the CSS of ypN (-) patients (P = 0.002) than on that of ypN (+) patients (P = 0.521). In ypT2N0 and ypT3N0, CSS was better for TRG2 than for TRG3 (P = 0.041, P = 0.048), and in ypN (-) and TRG2 tumors, CSS was better for ypT1-2 than for ypT3-4 (P = 0.034). TRG was found to be the strongest prognostic factor in patients without lymph node metastasis (ypN0), and different survival was observed according to TRG among patients with a specific histopathologic stage. Thus, TRG may provide an accurate prediction of prognosis and may be used for f tailoring treatment for patients without lymph node metastasis."

        "abstract": "Leukostasis is a medical emergency with high mortality which often occurs in acute myeloid leukemia patients with hyperleukocytosis. One of the\u00a0therapies that can be used for leukostasis in acute myeloid leukemia is leukapheresis. However, whether leukapheresis can provide better survival benefit when compared with patients not receiving leukapheresis is still unclear. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the effect of chemotherapy plus leukapheresis combination versus chemotherapy only on 28-day survival of acute myeloid leukemia patients with leukostasis. This study was a dual-center retrospective cohort using secondary data from medical records collected from November 2018 to March 2019. Inclusion criteria were adult patients aged 18 years old or above, diagnosed with acute leukemia with hyperleukocytosis status defined by WBC count greater than 100,000/uL, and with symptoms of leukostasis. One-month survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan\u2013Meier curve method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were then conducted using Cox proportional hazards model to obtain value of hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of 38 patients were obtained for analysis. The median overall survival was 25 days (95% CI: 17.001\u201332.999 days) in the chemotherapy only group and 20 days (95% CI: 1.497\u201338.503) in the chemotherapy with leukapheresis group. The use of leukapheresis did not affect 28-day survival (HR: 1.140; 95% CI: 0.396\u20133.283; p value: 0.809) and 7-day survival (HR: 1.073; 95% CI: 0.277\u20134.152; p value: 0.919). In the multivariate analysis, age \u226560 years, blast percentage \u226590%, creatinine \u22651.4 mg/dL, and presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation were associated with worse 28-day survival. AML patients with leukostasis who received both chemotherapy and leukapheresis did not have better 28-day survival and 7-day survival when compared with patients receiving chemotherapy only. Old age, high blast percentage, high creatinine, and presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation were prognostic factors for worse 28-day survival."

These compounds exhibited excellent potency against wild-type (WT) HIV-1 with EC 50 values ranging from 2.6 to 39\u00a0nmol/L and most of them showed low nanomolar anti-viral potency against a panel of HIV-1 mutant strains. Compounds 5j and 6k had the best activity against WT, single and double HIV-1 mutants and reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme comparable to two reference drugs (EFV and ETR) and our lead compound NP-DATA ( 1 ). Molecular modeling disclosed that the side chain at the C-6 position of DATAs occupied the entrance channel of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase non-nucleoside binding pocket (NNIBP) attributing to the improved activity. The preliminary structure\u2013activity relationship and PK profiles were also discussed.

The elevated plus-maze (EPM) has broadly been used to investigate anxiolytic and anxiogenic compounds. The present study investigated the effects of intraperitoneal (IP) injection of cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist (AM251) in the presence of alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist (Prazosin) on rat behavior in the EPM. In this study, the data were obtained from male Wistar rat, which weighing 200- 250 g. Animal behavior in EPM were videotaped and saved in computer for 10 min after IP injection of saline, AM251 (0.3 mg/kg), Prazosin (0.3 mg/kg) and AM251 + Prazosin, subsequently scored for conventional indices of anxiety. During the test period, the number of open and closed arms entries, the percentage of entries into the open arms of the EPM, and the spent time in open and closed arms were recorded. Diazepam was considered as a positive control drug with anxiolytic effect (0.3, 0.6, 1.2 mg/kg). Diazepam increased the number of open arm entries and the percentage of spent time on the open arms. IP injection of AM251 before EPM trial decreased open arms exploration and open arm entry. Whereas, Prazosin increased open arms exploration and open arm entry. This study showed that both substances in simultaneous injection have conflicting effects on the responses of each of these two compounds in a single injection. Injection of CB1 receptor antagonist may have an anxiogenic profile in rat, whereas adrenergic antagonist has an anxiolytic effect. Further investigations are essential for better understanding of anxiolytic and anxiogenic properties and neurobiological mechanisms of action and probable interactions of the two systems."

        "abstract": "Radiesse \u00ae (Calcium hydroxylapatite [CaHA]) is a biocompatible, injectable gel for facial soft tissue augmentation. It is a completely biodegradable filler and this is well documented, but objective imaging methods to confirm this property are scarce. We present a case report in which CaHA was injected into the midface of a 50-year-old woman for volume restoration and shaping of the cheek region. On the right side of the face, 1.6 mL CaHA was injected as several (5\u22127) small depots (0.1\u22120.2 mL) using a 28G 3/4 inch needle and the vertical supraperiosteal depot technique. On the contralateral side of the face, the subject received 1.6 mL CaHA over three entry points using a 27G 1 1/2 inch blunt cannula and the fanning technique. CaHA location and degradation were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CaHA appears as low-to-intermediate signal intensity on MRI images taken immediately after injection for malar enhancement with a symmetrical distribution. On MRI images taken 2.5 years after injection, no CaHA was visible but tissue volume remained increased, indicating a collagen-stimulating effect. The treatment was well tolerated. In addition to producing long-lasting aesthetic and collagen-stimulating effects, MRI images confirm that CaHA is completely biodegradable with no product remaining 2.5 years after injection."

The increased complexity leads to longer dose delivery times for each fraction. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of prolonged fraction delivery time with high-dose hypofractionation on the killing of cultured ACHN cells. The radiobiological characteristics and repair half-time of human ACHN renal cell carcinoma cell line were studied with clonogenic assays. A total dose of 20 Gy was administered in 1, 2 or 3 fractions over 15, 30 or 45 min to investigate the biological effectiveness of radiation delivery time and hypofractionation. Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis was performed after 3-fraction irradiation over 30 and 45 min. The \u03b1/\u03b2 and repair half-time were 5.2 Gy and 19 min, respectively. The surviving fractions increased with increase in the fraction delivery time and decreased more pronouncedly with increase in the fraction number over a treatment period of 30 to 45 min. With increase in the total radiation time to 30 and 45 min, it was found that with the same total dose, 2- and 3-fraction irradiation led to more cell killing than 1-fraction irradiation. 3-fraction radiation induced G2/M arrest, and the percentage of apoptotic cells decreased when the fraction delivery time increased from 30 min to 45 min. Our findings revealed that sublethal damage repair and redistribution of the cell cycle were predominant factors affecting cell response in the prolonged and hypofractionated irradiation regimes, respectively."

This prospective study was conducted from March 2014 to February 2018 and included extra-articular distal humeral fractures managed by operative fixation using extra-articular distal humerus locking plate. All the fractures were approached using lateral para-tricepetal approach of Gervin, and stabilized with extra-articular distal humerus locking plate with or without lag screws. Time to radiological union was assessed in the follow up and at the final follow up functional outcome was evaluated using Mayo Performance Elbow Score (MEPS). Complications and need for any additional procedures was also recorded. A total of 20 patients with mean age of 36.5 years and an average follow up of 17 months were included. The mean time to radiological union was 17.4 weeks (12 to 36 weeks) which included one delayed union that required bone grafting. The mean flexion at elbow was 127o with only one patient having flexion extension arc movement of less than 100o at the final follow up. The average MEPS at final follow up was 94.7\u00b18 with 19 patients having excellent and good results. Use of extra-articular distal humeral locking plate using lateral para-tricepetal approach in extra-articular distal humeral fractures allows stable fixation of the fracture to allow early return to function with minimal soft tissue dissection and excellent final functional results and minimum complications."

        "abstract": "Artificial oocyte activation (AOA) is an effective method to avoid total fertilization failure in human in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) cycles. AOA performed using a calcium ionophore can induce calcium oscillation in oocytes and initiate the fertilization process. We evaluated the usefulness of AOA with a calcium ionophore in cases of total fertilization failure in previous cycles and in cases of severe male factor infertility patients with non-motile spermatozoa after pentoxifylline (PF) treatment. The present study describes 29 intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)-AOA cycles involving male factor infertility at Cheil General Hospital from January 2006 to June 2013. Patients were divided into two groups (control, n=480; AOA, n=29) depending on whether or not AOA using a calcium ionophore (A23187) was performed after testicular sperm extraction-ICSI (TESE-ICSI). The AOA group was further split into subgroups according to sperm motility after PF treatment: i.e., motile sperm-injected (n=12) and non-motile sperm-injected (n=17) groups (total n=29 cycles). The good embryo rate (52.3% vs. 66.9%), pregnancy rate (20.7% vs. 52.1%), and delivery rate (10.3% vs. 40.8%) were lower in the PF/AOA group than in the control group. When evaluating the effects of restoration of sperm motility after PF treatment on clinical outcomes there was no difference in fertilization rate (66.6% vs. 64.7% in non-motile and motile sperm, respectively), pregnancy rate (17.6% vs. 33.3%), or delivery rate (5.9% vs. 16.7%) between the two groups. We suggest that oocyte activation is a useful method to ensure fertilization in TESE-ICSI cycles regardless of restoration of sperm motility after PF treatment. AOA may be useful in selected patients who have a low fertilization rate or total fertilization failure."

Our aim was to identify plasma ECM proteins associated to end\u2010stage HF and secondary PH in relation to haemodynamics, before and after heart transplantation (HT). Twenty ECM plasma proteins were analysed with proximity extension assay in 20 controls and 26 HF patients pre\u2010HT and 1 year post\u2010HT. Right heart catherization haemodynamics were assessed in the patients during the preoperative evaluation and at the 1 year follow\u2010up post\u2010HT. Plasma levels of prolargin and matrix metalloproteinase\u20102 (MMP\u20102) were elevated ( P < 0.0001) in HF patients compared with controls and decreased ( P < 0.0001) post\u2010HT towards controls' levels. The decrease in prolargin post\u2010HT correlated with improved mean right atrial pressure ( r  s = 0.63; P = 0.00091), stroke volume index ( r  s = \u22120.73; P < 0.0001), cardiac index ( r  s = \u22120.64; P = 0.00057), left ventricular stroke work index ( r  s = \u22120.49; P = 0.015), and N\u2010terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide ( r  s = 0.7; P < 0.0001).

The normalization pattern in HF patients of plasma prolargin and MMP\u20102 post\u2010HT towards controls' levels and their associations with improved haemodynamics indicate that prolargin and MMP\u20102 may reflect, in part, the aberrant ECM remodelling involved in the pathophysiology of HF and associated PH.

Herein, we aimed to monitor the changes of neuorinflammation after AMD3100 treatment using a translocator protein (TSPO) specific PET tracer in a mouse model of stroke. The transient MCAO model was established with Balb/C mice. The success of the model was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and FDG PET. The treatment started the same day after surgery via daily intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg of AMD3100/kg for three consecutive days. [ 18 F]DPA-714 was used as the TSPO imaging tracer. In vivo PET was performed at different time points after surgery in both control and treated mice. Ex vivo histological and immunofluorescence staining of brain slices was performed to confirm the lesion site and inflammatory cell activation. The TSPO level was also evaluated using Western blotting. Longitudinal PET scans revealed that the level of [ 18 F]DPA-714 uptake was significantly increased in the ischemic brain area with a peak accumulation at around day 10 after surgery, and the level of uptake remained high until day 16. The in vivo PET data were consistent with those from ex vivo immunofluorescence staining. After AMD3100 treatment, the signal intensity was significantly decreased compared with that of normal saline-treated control group. In conclusion, TSPO-targeted PET imaging using [ 18 F]DPA-714 can be used to monitor inflammatory response after stroke and provide a useful method for evaluating the efficacy of anti-inflammation treatment."

In order to prevent childhood hookworm disease in resource poor settings, a recombinant vaccine is under development by the Sabin Vaccine Institute and Texas Children\u2019s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, a Product Development Partnership (PDP). Previously, we reported on the expression and purification of a highly promising hookworm vaccine candidate, Na -GST-1, an N. americanus glutathione s-transferase expressed in Pichia pastoris (yeast), which led to production of 1.5 g of 95% pure recombinant protein at a 20L scale. 1 , 2 , 3 This yield and purity of Na -GST-1 was sufficient for early pilot manufacturing and initial phase 1 clinical testing. However, based on the number of doses which would be required to allow mass vaccination and a potential goal to deliver a vaccine as inexpensively as possible, a higher yield of expression of the recombinant antigen at the lowest possible cost is highly desirable. Here we report on modifications to the fermentation (upstream process) of the antigen expressed in P. pastoris, and to the purification (downstream process) of the recombinant protein that allowed for a 2\u20133-fold improvement in the final yield of Na -GST-1 purified protein. The major improvements included upstream process changes such as the addition of a sorbitol pulse and co-feed during methanol induction as well as an extension of the induction stage to approximately 96 hours; downstream process changes included modifying the UFDF to flat sheet with a 10 kDa Molecular Weight cut-off (MWCO), adjusting the capacity of an ion-exchange chromatography step utilizing a gradient elution as opposed to the original step elution, and altering the hydrophobic interaction chromatography conditions. The full process, as well as the purity and stability profiles of the target Na -GST-1, and its formulation on Alhydrogel \u00ae , is described."

Although the generation of aberrant SVs (e.g. AR-v7/sst5TMD4/etc.) is associated to prostate-cancer (PCa) aggressiveness and/or castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) development, whether the molecular reason behind such phenomena might be linked to a dysregulation of the cellular machinery responsible for the splicing process [spliceosome-components (SCs) and splicing-factors (SFs)] has not been yet explored. Expression levels of 43 key SCs and SFs were measured in two cohorts of PCa-samples: 1) Clinically-localized formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded PCa-samples ( n =\u202f84), and 2) highly-aggressive freshly-obtained PCa-samples ( n =\u202f42). A profound dysregulation in the expression of multiple components of the splicing machinery (i.e. 7 SCs/19 SFs) were found in PCa compared to their non-tumor adjacent-regions. Notably, overexpression of SNRNP200, SRSF3 and SRRM1 (mRNA and/or protein) were associated with relevant clinical (e.g. Gleason score, T-Stage, metastasis, biochemical recurrence, etc.) and molecular (e.g. AR-v7 expression) parameters of aggressiveness in PCa-samples. Functional (cell-proliferation/migration) and mechanistic [gene-expression (qPCR) and protein-levels (western-blot)] assays were performed in normal prostate cells (PNT2) and PCa-cells (LNCaP/22Rv1/PC-3/DU145 cell-lines) in response to SNRNP200, SRSF3 and/or SRRM1 silencing (using specific siRNAs) revealed an overall decrease in proliferation/migration-rate in PCa-cells through the modulation of key oncogenic SVs expression levels (e.g. AR-v7 / PKM2 / XBP1s ) and alteration of oncogenic signaling pathways (e.g. p-AKT/p-JNK). These results demonstrate that the spliceosome is drastically altered in PCa wherein SNRNP200, SRSF3 and SRRM1 could represent attractive novel diagnostic/prognostic and therapeutic targets for PCa and CRPC."

        "abstract": "In August 2012, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence produced positive diagnostics guidance on the ultrasound contrast agent SonoVue\u00ae, but recommended further research involving an estimation of the proportion of unenhanced ultrasound scans reporting, but not characterising, focal liver lesions, particularly in cirrhotic livers. Patient records from the Radiology Information System of an acute hospital trust were progressively filtered based on categorical fields and keywords in the free text reports, to obtain ultrasound records including the liver that were appropriate for manual analysis. In total, 21,731 records referred from general practice or out-patient clinics were analysed. Patients described as having cirrhosis were analysed as a subgroup. After automatic exclusion of records considered likely to be negative, 5812 records were manually read and categorised as focal liver lesion inconclusive, benign or malignant. In the general practice cohort of 9175 records, 746 reported the presence of one or more focal liver lesions, with 18.4% (95% CI 15.7% to 21.3%) of these records mentioning an inconclusive focal liver lesion. In the out-patient cohort of 12,556 records, 1437 reported one or more focal liver lesions, and 29.4% (95% CI 26.9% to 32.0%) of these were inconclusive. Cirrhosis was reported in 10.8% of the out-patient scans that also reported a focal liver lesion, and 47.4% (95% CI 39.3% to 55.6%) of these scans had an inconclusive focal liver lesion, compared with 27.3% (95% CI 24.9% to 29.8%) that were inconclusive in non-cirrhotic livers (odds ratio 2.4; 95% CI 1.7 to 3.4). This retrospective study indicates that unenhanced ultrasound scans, in which a focal liver lesion is detected, are frequently inconclusive, with the probability of an inconclusive scan being greater in out-patient than general practice referrals. Inconclusive focal liver lesions were also reported in greater proportions of cirrhotic than non-cirrhotic livers. The results of this research will inform future updates of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence diagnostics guidance."

In early 2004, two papers have been published: One claiming that GPR80/99 is an AMP receptor, called P2Y 15 , and the other one showing that GPR80/99 is a receptor for \u03b1-ketoglutarate, while GPR91 is a succinate receptor. The accompanying paper by Qi et al. entirely supports that GPR80/99 is an \u03b1-ketoglutarate receptor and not an AMP receptor. The closeness of dicarboxylic acid and P2Y nucleotide receptors might be linked to the negative charges of both types of ligands and the involvement of conserved Arg residues in their neutralization."

Ziprasidone hydrochloride monohydrate was heated from 30 to 150\u00b0 with a heating rate of 5\u00b0 per min under nitrogen gas atmosphere and weight loss data were collected. Powder X-ray difraction was used to characterize the solid before and after dehydration. The well accepted Coats-Redfern model fitting approach was applied to the thermogravimetry data for the kinetic analysis. Thirteen solid state reaction models were studied; among them one-dimensional diffusion model was found to be the best fit model for this reaction with an excellent correlation 0.9994. The Arrhenius parameters, activation energy, and pre-exponential factor were determined, the values were found to be 28 k.cal/mol and 9.53\u00d710 13 sec \u22121 , respectively."

Bevacizumab, a VEGF-A neutralizing monoclonal antibody, has shown clinical activity in this setting. To our knowledge, however, although some diabetic cancer patients treated with bevacizumab may also take metformin, whether metformin modulates response to anti-VEGF therapy has not yet been investigated. Here, we report the case of a patient with advanced EC treated, among other drugs, with bevacizumab in combination with metformin. The patient affected by relapsed EC G3 type 1, presented in march 2010 with liver, lungs and mediastinic metastases. After six cycles of paclitaxel and cisplatin she underwent partial response. Later on, she had disease progression notwithstanding administration of multiple lines of chemotherapy. In march 2013, due to brain metastases with coma, she began steroid therapy with development of secondary diabetes. At this time, administration of Bevacizumab plus Metformin improved her performance status. CT scans performed in this time window showed reduced radiologic density of the lung and mediastinic lesions and of liver disease, suggestive of increased tumor necrosis. Strong 18 F-FDG uptake by PET imaging along with high levels of monocarboxylate transporter 4 and lack of liver kinase B1 expression in liver metastasis, highlighted metabolic features previously associated with response to anti-VEGF therapy and phenformin in preclinical models. However, clinical benefit was transitory and was followed by rapid and fatal disease progression. These findings\u2014albeit limited to a single case\u2014suggest that tumors lacking LKB1 expression and/or endowed with an highly glycolytic phenotype might develop large necrotic areas following combined treatment with metformin plus bevacizumab. As metformin is widely used among diabetes patients as well as in ongoing clinical trials in cancer patients, these results deserve further clinical investigation."

This review examines how patients choose their physician for continuous outpatient care and why they are willing to bypass the nearest physician. It was conducted according to the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Three databases (PubMed/Medline, ScienceDirect, and Ovid Medline) were searched, focusing on articles in which distance influenced the choice of physician. In all, 1,308 articles were accessed, and 17 selected for final review. First, we extracted methods for assessing distance traveled and bypassing. Second, we identified determinants that directly influence the traveled distance and transferred all into a conceptual framework. The center of this framework is the individual \u201cwillingness-to-go\u201d, which reflects the willingness of patients to accept additional distances. Our findings can support studies on patient mobility and physician choice, which are essential for examining both the distribution and use of medical services, as well as for adequate need related planning."

Eight male and twelve female depressive patients, diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria, were included in this study. The subjects aged 19-50 years, did not smoke, and had normal body mass index (BMI), homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values, blood pressure, blood glucose, insulin and lipid levels. Sertraline therapy (50 mg/day) was started. Patients with diabetes mellitus, heart disease, pregnancy, and those taking other drugs were excluded from the study. Blood glucose, insulin, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglyceride values were measured in patients before, and at the 4 th , 8 th and 12 th weeks after treatment with sertraline. Moreover, HbA1C levels were measured at the beginning and at the end of the treatment (at 12 th weeks). There were no significant differences in physical examination (blood pressure, BMI, body weight, height, waist circumference) and laboratory findings (glucose, HDL-C, LDL-C, HOMA-IR and HbA1C levels) at the 12 th week after of treatment with sertraline compared to pretreatment values. However, insulin levels at the 4 th , 8 th and 12 th weeks significantly increased compared with pretreatment values. Likewise, triglyceride levels at the 8 th and 12 th weeks significantly increased compared with pretreatment values. Sertraline-treated patients have to be followed up for blood insulin and triglyceride levels. In addition, their treatment plan needs to be adjusted as necessary to prevent possible metabolic changes."

However, few studies have focused on the expression of HBsAg in HCC patients\u2019 liver tissues. This study aimed to explore the potential utility of using HBsAg protein expression in normal liver tissues as a prognostic factor for HCC patients who underwent liver resection. The study enrolled 100 HCC patients with seropositivity for HBsAg. The liver tissues were collected, and tissue microarrays were constructed. The expression of HBsAg in liver tissues were measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Relevant clinical data and follow-up records were collected for analysis. HBsAg expressions was detected in 29 patients (positive group) and was unable to be detected in the remaining 71 patients (negative group). The patients in the positive group had higher HBV DNA levels ( P < 0.05) than the patients in the negative group. The overall survival (OS) rate of the positive group was worse than the OS rate of the negative group ( P = 0.013). The OS rates after resection at 1 and 2 years in negative group were 90.1% and 85.7%, respectively, while the value in the positive group were 79.3% and 65.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that HBsAg expression in liver tissues, ascites and alpha-fetoprotein levels were independent factors influencing OS. Similarly, after propensity score matching (PSM), the OS was worse in the positive group than in the negative group, and HBsAg expression could also serve as a predictor for OS ( P = 0.039). The OS rates after resection and PSM at 1 and 2 years were 93.2% and 85.9% in the negative group, while the value in the positive group were 79.3% and 65.5%. As determined according to grouping based on immunohistochemistry staining results for HBsAg, this study indicated that HBsAg expression in liver tissues could predict the OS of HBV-related HCC patients after liver resection."

However, the failure of IDO1 inhibitors when used in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), as observed in clinical trials, raises a number of questions. This study aimed to investigate the association of tryptophan 2,3\u2010dioxygenase (TDO) and IDO1 with cancer development and resistance to immunotherapy in patients with RCC. In our analysis of RCC tissue samples, tissue Kyn levels were elevated in advanced\u2010stage RCC and correlated well with TDO expression levels in RCC tumor cells. In patients with mRCC, TDO rather than IDO1 was expressed in RCC tumor cells, showing a strong association with Kyn expression. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of TDO was strongly associated with the staining intensity of forkhead box P3, as well as ICI therapy response and survival in patients with mRCC. Our study is the first to show that TDO expression in tumor tissues is associated with progression and survival, confirming its potential as a predictive biomarker of primary resistance to immunotherapy in patients with mRCC. Our findings suggest that strategies aimed at inhibiting TDO, rather than IDO1, in combination with ICI therapy may aid in the control of mRCC progression. This study aimed to investigate the association of tryptophan 2,3\u2010dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3\u2010dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) with cancer development and resistance to immunotherapy in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients. Our results suggest that TDO expression in tumor cells is associated with kynurenine accumulation, progression, and survival, confirming its potential as a predictive biomarker of primary resistance to immunotherapy in RCC patients. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first to show that the accumulation of kynurenine induced by TDO in tumor tissues is associated with progression and survival. Further, we believe that this paper will be of interest to the readership of your journal because our results strongly recommend the testing of specific TDO inhibitors or dual inhibitors of IDO1 and TDO with ICI treatment in future preclinical and clinical trials focusing on mRCC.

        "abstract": "Plastid-localized NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase C (NTRC) is a unique NTR enzyme containing both reductase and thioredoxin domains in a single polypeptide. Arabidopsis thaliana NTRC knockout lines ( ntrc ) show retarded growth, especially under short-day (SD) photoperiods. This study identified chloroplast processes that accounted for growth reduction in SD-acclimated ntrc . The strongest reduction in ntrc growth occurred under photoperiods with nights longer than 14h, whereas knockout of the NTRC gene did not alter the circadian-clock-controlled growth of Arabidopsis . Lack of NTRC modulated chloroplast reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, but oxidative stress was not the primary cause of retarded growth of SD-acclimated ntrc . Scarcity of starch accumulation made ntrc leaves particularly vulnerable to photoperiods with long nights. Direct interaction of NTRC and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, a key enzyme in starch synthesis, was confirmed by yeast two-hybrid analysis. The ntrc line was not able to maximize starch synthesis during the light period, which was particularly detrimental under SD conditions. Acclimation of Arabidopsis to SD conditions also involved an inductive rise of ROS production in illuminated chloroplasts that was not counterbalanced by the activation of plastidial anti-oxidative systems. It is proposed that knockout of NTRC challenges redox regulation of starch synthesis, resulting in stunted growth of the mutant lines acclimated to the SD photoperiod."

Furthermore, cases of re-infection were mainly due to different variants or mutant SARS-CoV-2. Following the fast and pandemic-scale spread of COVID-19, mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have raised new diagnostic challenges which include the redesign of the oligonucleotide sequences used in RT-PCR assays to avoid potential primer\u2013sample mismatches, and decrease sensitivities. Since the initial wave of the pandemic, some regions had experienced fresh outbreaks, predisposing people to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 re-infection.

When intestinal epithelial barrier integrity is compromised, commensal bacteria are likely to translocate from the gut lumen into the lamina propria. Few studies have addressed the mechanisms by which commensal bacteria impact the function of gut Group 1 ILCs, especially ILC1s. Utilizing an in vitro human colonic lamina propria mononuclear cell (LPMC) model, we evaluated Group 1 ILC cytokine and cytolytic protein production in response to a panel of enteric Gram-positive and Gram-negative commensal and pathogenic bacteria. IFN\u03b3-production by NK cells and ILC1s was significantly increased after LPMC exposure to Gram-negative commensal or pathogenic bacteria, but not after exposure to the Gram-positive bacteria commensals tested. Stimulation of IFN\u03b3 production from Group 1 ILCs was not through direct recognition of bacteria by NK cells or ILC1s, but rather required accessory cells within the LPMC population. Myeloid dendritic cells generated IL-12p70, IL-18, and IL-1\u03b2 upon exposure to enteric bacteria and these cytokines contributed to Group 1 ILC production of IFN\u03b3. Furthermore, Gram-negative commensal or pathogenic bacteria induced significant expression of Granzyme B in NK cells and ILC1s. Overall, these data demonstrate that some enteric commensal bacteria indirectly induce inflammatory cytokine production and cytolytic protein expression from human colonic Group 1 ILCs, a process which could contribute to inflammation in the setting of microbial translocation."

In the United Kingdom, development and implementation of the national immunisation programme is centrally coordinated and funded by the Department of Health on behalf of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. A number of significant changes were made to the UK immunisation schedule for 2013/2014. Three new vaccines were introduced: intranasal influenza and oral rotavirus for children and subcutaneous shingles for older adults. To ensure protection against meningococcal C infection into adulthood, there has been a change to the schedule for meningitis C vaccination. The temporary pertussis vaccination programme for pregnant women, set up in response to an increase in the number of cases of pertussis particularly among young babies, has been extended until further notice. Furthermore, in response to large outbreaks of measles in south Wales and other parts of the UK, a national measles, mumps and rubella catch-up campaign specifically targeted at unvaccinated children aged 10\u201316 years was launched to ensure that all children and young people have received two doses of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.

The aim of this study was to compare PLF rates between 1 and 2 years of follow-up and between graft types, and to explore the role of bone grafting based on the location of the PLF mass. There are indications that bony fusion proceeds over time, but it is unknown to what extent this can be related to bone grafting. A total of 100 adult patients underwent a primary, single- or multilevel, thoracolumbar PLF. After instrumentation and preparation for grafting, the randomized allocation side of AttraX \u00ae Putty was disclosed. The contralateral posterolateral gutters were grafted with autograft. At 1-year follow-up, and in case of no fusion at 2 years, the fusion status of both sides of each segment was blindly assessed on CT scans. Intertransverse and facet fusion were scored separately. Difference in fusion rates after 1 and 2 years and between grafts were analyzed with a Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model ( P <\u200a0.05). The 2-year PLF rate (66 patients) was 70% at the AttraX \u00ae Putty and 68% at the autograft side, compared to 55% and 52% after 1 year (87 patients). GEE analysis demonstrated a significant increase for both conditions (odds ratio 2.0, 95% confidence interval 1.5\u20132.7, P <\u200a0.001), but no difference between the grafts ( P =\u200a0.595). Ongoing bone formation was only observed between the facet joints. This intra-patient controlled trial demonstrated a significant increase in PLF rate between 1 and 2 years after instrumented thoracolumbar fusion, but no difference between AttraX \u00ae Putty and autograft. Based on the location of the PLF mass, this increase is most likely the result of immobilization instead of grafting. Level of Evidence: 1"

        "abstract": "Higher serum bile acid levels are associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis and liver-related morbidity and mortality. Herein, we report secondary analyses of aldafermin, an engineered analogue of the gut hormone fibroblast growth factor 19, on the circulating bile acid profile in prospective, phase II studies in patients with metabolic or cholestatic liver disease. One hundred and seventy-six patients with biopsy-confirmed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis and elevated liver fat content (\u22658% by magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction) received 0.3 mg (n = 23), 1 mg (n = 49), 3 mg (n = 49), 6 mg (n = 28) aldafermin or placebo (n = 27) for 12 weeks. Sixty-two patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and elevated alkaline phosphatase (>1.5\u00d7 upper limit of normal) received 1 mg (n = 21), 3 mg (n = 21) aldafermin or placebo (n = 20) for 12 weeks. Serum samples were collected on day 1 and week 12 for determination of bile acid profile and neoepitope-specific N-terminal pro-peptide of type III collagen (Pro-C3), a direct measure of fibrogenesis. Treatment with aldafermin resulted in significant dose-dependent reductions in serum bile acids. In particular, bile acids with higher hydrophobicity indices, such as deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, and glycocholic acid, were markedly lowered by aldafermin in both NASH and PSC populations. Moreover, aldafermin predominantly suppressed the glycine-conjugated bile acids, rather than the taurine-conjugated bile acids. Changes in levels of bile acids correlated with changes in the novel fibrogenesis marker Pro-C3, which detects a neo-epitope of the type III collagen during its formation, in the pooled NASH and PSC populations. Aldafermin markedly reduced major hydrophobic bile acids that have greater detergent activity and cytotoxicity. Our data provide evidence that bile acids may contribute to sustaining a pro-fibrogenic microenvironment in the liver across metabolic and cholestatic liver diseases. Aldafermin is an analogue of a gut hormone, which is in development as a treatment for patients with chronic liver disease. Herein, we show that aldafermin can potently and robustly suppress the toxic, hydrophobic bile acids irrespective of disease aetiology. The therapeutic strategy utilising aldafermin may be broadly applicable to other chronic gastrointestinal and liver disorders. The study is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02443116 and NCT02704364 . \u2022 Higher serum bile acid levels are associated with an increased risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality. \u2022 Aldafermin produces significant dose-dependent reductions in toxic hydrophobic bile acids in NASH and PSC. \u2022 Changes in bile acids correlate with changes in the novel fibrogenesis marker Pro-C3. \u2022 Bile acids may contribute to a pro-fibrogenic microenvironment in the liver.

        "abstract": "The TP53 pathway, in which TP53 and its negative regulator MDM2 are the central elements, has an important role in carcinogenesis, particularly in BRCA1- and BRCA2- mediated carcinogenesis. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region of MDM2 (309T>G, rs2279744) and a coding SNP of TP53 (Arg72Pro, rs1042522) have been shown to be of functional significance. To investigate whether these SNPs modify breast cancer risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, we pooled genotype data on the TP53 Arg72Pro SNP in 7011 mutation carriers and on the MDM2 309T>G SNP in 2222 mutation carriers from the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA). Data were analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model within a retrospective likelihood framework. No association was found between these SNPs and breast cancer risk for BRCA1 ( TP53 : per-allele hazard ratio (HR)=1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93\u20131.10, P trend =0.77; MDM2 : HR=0.96, 95%CI: 0.84\u20131.09, P trend =0.54) or for BRCA2 mutation carriers ( TP53 : HR=0.99, 95%CI: 0.87\u20131.12, P trend =0.83; MDM2 : HR=0.98, 95%CI: 0.80\u20131.21, P trend =0.88). We also evaluated the potential combined effects of both SNPs on breast cancer risk, however, none of their combined genotypes showed any evidence of association. There was no evidence that TP53 Arg72Pro or MDM2 309T>G, either singly or in combination, influence breast cancer risk in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers."

        "abstract": "Neuromodulation can affect the functioning of the central nervous system (CNS), and emotional/eating behavior is an exciting facet of that functioning. Therefore, it would be possible to offer an alternative (or complement) treatment to psychotropic medications and different psychological and nutritional approaches to both eating disorders (EDs) and obesity. Although there are a number of publications in these areas, a systematic review has not been conducted to date. Abstracts, letters, conference reports, dissertations, and reviews were excluded. Clinical trials and controlled human clinical trials were filtered and included in this study. Articles included were based on the population suffering from anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge ED, overweight, and obesity. No restrictions were placed on the sample size. Only trials investigating the effect of neuromodulation by means of deep brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were included. The following databases were used to conduct the search: MEDLINE/ PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycArticles, and Cochrane (Search Trials, CENTRAL). Study selection was performed following the PRISMA process (PRISMA 2009 Checklist). The total number of participants in all the trials was 562 (DBS, 25; tDCS, 138; TMS, 399; range, 3\u201390; median, 23.5). As a result, 50% of the studies had samples of between 14 and 38 participants. Neuro-modulation in ED seems to have certain clinical potential, and therefore, this is a promising area for further research. Developments in ED neuromodulation will be linked to neuroimaging to identify potential stimulation targets and possible biomarkers of treatment response. To date, TMS and/or direct current stimulation (DCS) is not the first-line treatment yet, but it could become a preferred option of treatment in the future. Further studies should avoid small sample sizes and the use of different methodologies. Currently, neuromodulation techniques are in the experimental phase, and they are not an evidence-based treatment for ED."

The present study aimed to assess the association between microRNA-212-3p (miR-212-3p) and SOX11, and the effects of miR-212-3p on cell proliferation and migration in mantle cell lymphoma. Cancer tissue and corresponding paracancerous tissue samples were collected from 65 patients with mantle cell lymphoma. The mRNA expression levels of miR-212-3p and SOX11 were analyzed using quantitative PCR, and SOX11 protein expression was determined using western blotting. Following transfection, the miR-212-3p mimic group exhibited a significantly lower SOX11 mRNA and protein expression than the miR-NC group. After 48\u201372 h of transfection, cell proliferation in the miR-212-3p mimic group was significantly lower than that in the miR-NC group. Furthermore, the miR-212-3p mimic group exhibited significantly lower cell invasion and significantly higher apoptosis than the miR-NC group. The current results suggested that miR-212-3p inhibited lymphoma cell proliferation and migration, and promoted their apoptosis by specifically regulating SOX11. Therefore, miR-212-3p may serve as a novel therapeutic target and marker for lymphoma."

Strigolactones induce hyphal branching in AM fungi at very low concentrations, suggesting a highly sensitive perception system for strigolactones present in AM fungi. However, little is known about the structural requirements of strigolactones for hyphal branching in AM fungi. Here, we tested a series of natural and synthetically modified strigolactones as well as non-strigolactone-type germination stimulants for hyphal branching-inducing activity in germinating spores of the AM fungus Gigaspora margarita . All tested compounds with a tricyclic lactone coupled to a methylbutenolide via an enol ether bond showed activity, but differed in the active concentration and in the branching pattern of hyphae. Truncation of the A- and AB-rings in the tricyclic ABC lactone of strigolactones resulted in a drastic reduction in hyphal branching activity. Although the connection of the C-ring in the tricyclic lactone to the methylbutenolide D-ring was shown to be essential for hyphal branching, the bridge structure in the C\u2013D part was found not necessarily to be enol ether, being replaceable with either alkoxy or imino ethers. These structural requirements in AM fungi are very similar but not identical to those observed in root parasitic weeds, especially with respect to the enol ether bridge in the C\u2013D part."

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women. Hormone\u2010receptor\u2010positive breast cancer (HR\u00a0+\u00a0BC) is the most common pathological type of breast cancer, of which the main treatment method is endocrine therapy. Unfortunately, primary or acquired drug resistance greatly limits its efficacy. In recent years, the newly launched CDK4/6 inhibitors could effectively reverse endocrine resistance in breast cancer. However, considering their expensive price and side effects, it is particularly important to find out effective biomarkers and screen sensitive patients. Here, we found through bioinformatics analysis that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expression increased in endocrine\u2010resistant HR\u00a0+\u00a0BC. In clinical specimens, the higher expression of HMGB1 was associated with shorter progression\u2010free survival (PFS) for HR\u00a0+\u00a0BC patients with endocrine therapy after surgery. For endocrine\u2010resistant breast cancer, compared with HMGB1\u2010negative patients, HMGB1\u2010positive patients who received CDK4/6 inhibitors treatment benefited more in PFS. Moreover, we demonstrated that HMGB1 promoted tamoxifen resistance by combining with the Toll\u2010like receptor 4 (TLR4) and activating nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u2010\u03baB) pathway. CDK4/6 inhibitors could downregulate the expression of HMGB1 and suppress the TLR4\u2010NF\u2010\u03baB pathway, and in turn reverse tamoxifen resistance. These results illuminated the critical role of HMGB1 in the process of tamoxifen resistance, explained the mechanism of CDK4/6 inhibitors reversing tamoxifen resistance, and suggested the feasibility of HMGB1 as a potential biomarker for screening sensitive patients receiving CDK4/6 inhibitors. This article illustrated the critical role of HMGB1 in the process of endocrine therapy resistance, explained one of the mechanisms of CDK4/6 inhibitors reverse endocrine therapy resistance, and suggested the feasibility of HMGB1 as a potential biomarker for screening sensitive patients receiving CDK4/6 inhibitors.

However, little research addressed the longer-term psychological outcomes in this population. Therefore, we aimed to prospectively assess clinically relevant psychological distress in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and their relatives 90\u00a0days after hospital discharge. This exploratory, prospective, observational cohort study included consecutive adult patients hospitalized in two Swiss tertiary-care hospitals between March and June 2020 for confirmed COVID-19 and their relatives. The primary outcome was psychological distress defined as clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety and/or depression measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 90\u00a0days after discharge. Clinically relevant psychological distress 90\u00a0days after hospital discharge was present in 23/108 patients (21.3%) and 22/120 relatives (18.3%). For patients, risk and protective factors associated with clinically relevant psychological distress included sociodemographic, illness-related, psychosocial, and hospital-related factors. A model including these factors showed good discrimination, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84. For relatives, relevant risk factors were illness-related, psychosocial, and hospital-related factors. Resilience was negatively associated with anxiety and depression in both patients and relatives and regarding PTSD in relatives only. COVID-19 is linked to clinically relevant psychological distress in a subgroup of patients and their relatives 90\u00a0days after hospitalization. If confirmed in an independent and larger patient cohort, knowledge about these potential risk and protective factors might help to develop preventive strategies."

Zirconia blocks (Lava, 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) were obtained and forty sets of zirconia abutments and copings were fabricated using CAD/CAM technology. They were grouped into 4 categories as follows, depending on the types of resin cements used, and whether the primer is applied or not:Panavia F2.0 (P), Panavia F2.0 using Primer (PRIME Plus, Bisco Inc, Schaumburg, IL, USA) (PZ), Superbond C&B (S), and Superbond C&B using Primer (SZ). For each of the groups, the cementation was conducted. The specimens were kept in sterilized water (37\u2103) for 24 hours. Retentive forces were tested and measured, and a statistical analysis was carried out. The nature of failure was recorded. The means and standard deviations of retentive force in Newton for each group were 265.15 \u00b1 35.04 N (P), 318.21 \u00b1 22.24 N (PZ), 445.13 \u00b1 78.54 N (S) and 508.21 \u00b1 79.48 N (SZ). Superbond C&B groups (S & SZ) showed significantly higher retentive force than Panavia F2.0 groups (P & PZ). In Panavia F2.0 groups, the use of primer was found to contribute to the increase of retentive force. On the other hand, in Superbond C&B groups, the use of primer did not influence the retention forces. Adhesive failure was observed in all groups. This study suggests that cementation of the zirconia abutments and zirconia copings with Superbond C&B have a higher retentive force than Panavia F2.0. When using Panavia F2.0, the use of primer increases the retentive force."

Despite the large amount of literature available concerning the thermal stability and ageing behavior of Ti\u2013Nb alloys, only few studies were performed dealing with the isochronal transformation behavior of initially martensitic Ti\u2013Nb alloys. In this work, the formation of martensites ( \u03b1 \u2032 and \u03b1 \u2033) and their stability under different thermal processing conditions were investigated by a combination of x-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, dilatometry and electron microscopy. The effect of Nb additions on the structural competition in correlation with stable and metastable phase diagrams was also studied. Alloys with 24 wt% Nb or less undergo a transformation sequence on heating from room temperature to 1155 K. In alloys containing >24 wt% Nb \u03b1 \u2033 martensitically reverts back to \u03b2 0 , which is highly unstable against chemical demixing by formation of isothermal \u03c9 iso .

Group T 1 were supplemented with zinc at 60 ppm/d/cow, group T 2 were supplemented with vitamin E at 1,000 IU/d/cow and group T 3 were supplemented with combination of vitamin E at 1,000 IU/d/cow and zinc at 60 ppm/d/cow during d 60 prepartum to d 90 postpartum. Blood samples were collected on d \u221260, \u221245, \u221230, \u221215, \u22127, \u22123, 0, 3, 7, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 with respect to day of parturition and analysed for glucose, non esterified fatty acid, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance. Body condition score was maintained significantly better (p<0.05) in T 3 than in the control, T 1 and T 2 groups. Overall glucose level was higher (p<0.05) in T 3 than control, T 1 , and T 2 groups. Levels of nonesterified fatty acid, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance were lower (p<0.05) in T 3 than control, T 1 , and T 2 groups. Milk yield was higher (p<0.05) in T 3 than control, T 1 , and T 2 groups. In conclusion, the present study indicated that the supplementation of vitamin E and zinc in peripartum Sahiwal cows enhanced milk production by reducing negative energy balance."

These PNAs were conjugated with an octaarginine tail in order to obtain an efficient delivery to treated cells. The effects of singularly administered PNAs or a combined treatment with both PNAs were examined on apoptosis, with the aim to determine whether reversion of the drug-resistance phenotype was obtained. Specificity of the PNA-mediated effects was analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase-chain reaction, which demonstrated that the effects of R8-PNA-a155 and R8-PNA-a221 anti-miR PNAs were specific. Furthermore, the results obtained confirmed that both PNAs induced apoptosis when used on the temozolomide-resistant T98G glioma cell line. Notably, co-administration of both anti-miR-155 and anti-miR-221 PNAs was associated with an increased proapoptotic activity. In addition, TMZ further increased the induction of apoptosis in T98G cells co-treated with anti-miR-155 and anti-miR-221 PNAs."

This study aims to evaluate the effect of socio-economic, demographic and lifestyle factors on the prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults belonging to the Rengma-Naga population of North-east India. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 826 Rengma-Naga individuals (males: 422; females: 404) aged 20\u201349 years from the Karbi Anglong District of Assam, using a two-stage stratified random sampling. The socio-economic, demographic and lifestyle variables were recorded using structured schedules. Height and weight were recorded and the Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated using standard procedures and equation. The WHO (2000) cut-off points were utilized to assess the prevalence of overweight (BMI \u226523.00\u201324.99 kg/m 2 ) and obesity (BMI \u226525.00 kg/m 2 ). The data were analysed using ANOVA, chi-square analysis and binary logistic regression analysis using SPSS (version 17.0). The prevalence of overweight and obesity were 32.57% (males: 39.34%; females: 25.50%) and 10.77% (males: 9.95%; females: 11.63%), respectively. The binary logistic regression analysis showed that age groups (e.g., 40\u201349 years), education (\u22659 th standard), part-time occupation and monthly income (\u2265Rs.10000) were significantly associated with overweight and obesity (p<0.05). Age, education occupation and income appear to have higher associations with overweight and obesity among adults. Suitable healthcare strategies and intervention programmes are needed for combating such prevalence in population."

The phosphorylation state of every protein within a cell is strictly determined by spatiotemporally controlled kinase and phosphatase activities. Nuclear disassembly and reassembly during open mitosis in higher eukaryotic cells is one such process that is tightly regulated by the reversible phosphorylation of key proteins. However, little is known about the regulation of these mitotic events. In particular, although kinase function during entry into mitosis is better studied, very little is known about how proteins are dephosphorylated to allow nuclear reformation at the end of mitosis. We have identified LEM\u20114, a conserved protein of the nuclear envelope, as an essential coordinator of kinase and phosphatase activities during mitotic exit. Inhibition of VRK\u20111 kinase and promotion of a PP2A phosphatase complex by LEM\u20114 tightly regulate the phosphorylation state of BAF, an essential player of nuclear reformation at the end of mitosis. Here I offer extended comments on the contribution of LEM\u20114 in the regulation of protein phosphorylation and nuclear reformation."

A 50-year-old woman was diagnosed with MDS 5q deletion syndrome [del(5q)], becoming dependent on blood transfusion after long-term treatment with cytotoxic drugs for chronic scleritis. Lenalidomide therapy (10 mg/day) led to profound pancytopaenia, followed by recovery of her blood cell counts. A cytogenetic study, repeated 4 months after lenalidomide treatment, revealed complete remission after only 1 week of lenalidomide therapy. Lenalidomide was approved for low- and intermediate-1-risk MDS, where it normalises platelet counts and induces haematological and cytogenetic remission. This patient has remained transfusion independent for 3 years by continuing on a minimal maintenance dose of lenalidomide. Starting MDS patients on lenalidomide has to be done cautiously or with only 5 mg/day because of the potentially high sensitivity of the stem cells to this immunomodulatory agent in MDS patients."

VMN nitric oxide (NO) and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons and astrocytes express estrogen receptor-alpha (ER\u03b1) and ER-beta (ER\u03b2) proteins. Current research used selective ER\u03b1 (1,3 Bis (4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-methyl-5-[4-(2-piperidinylethoxy)phenol]-1H-pyrazole dihydrochloride) or ER\u03b2 (4-[2-phenyl-5,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl]phenol) antagonists to address the premise that these ERs govern basal and/or NE-associated patterns of VMN metabolic neuron signaling and astrocyte glycogen metabolism. Both ERs stimulate expression of the enzyme marker protein neuronal nitric oxide synthase, not glutamate decarboxylase 65/67 . NE inhibition or augmentation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase and glutamate decarboxylase 65/67 profiles was ER-independent or -dependent, respectively. In both neuron types, VMN ER\u03b2 activity inhibited baseline alpha1- (\u03b1 1 -) and/or alpha2- (\u03b1 2 -)adrenergic receptor (AR) expression, but ER\u03b1 and -\u03b2 signaling was paradoxically crucial for noradrenergic upregulation of \u03b1 2 -AR. NE inhibited glycogen synthase expression and exerted opposite effects on VMN adenosine monophosphate-sensitive glycogen phosphorylase (GP)-brain type (stimulatory) versus NE-sensitive GP muscle (inhibitory) via ER\u03b1 or -\u03b2 activity. Results document unique ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 actions on metabolic transmitter and AR protein expression in VMN nitrergic versus GABAergic neurons. ER effects varied in the presence versus absence of NE, indicating that both neuron types are substrates for estradiol and noradrenergic regulatory interaction. NE-dependent ER control of VMN GP variant expression implies that these signals also act on astrocytes to direct physiological stimulus-specific control of glycogen metabolism, which may in turn influence GABA transmission."

        "abstract": "One of the most critical long-term complications of type 2 diabetes is nephropathy, currently termed diabetic kidney disease. Although the prevalence is increasing, renal outcomes are heterogeneously defined. Intensive glucose control is effective for the prevention of microvascular complications, including kidney disease. However, the impact of specific drugs on renal outcome measures such as the incidence of kidney disease, albuminuria, progression to end-stage kidney disease, or death of renal cause remains unclear. Comparison of agents or drug classes is impossible, as renal outcomes are inconsistently defined in trials. Recent publications include more stringent criteria, but use only composite endpoints, which can reveal significant results driven by a single surrogate marker but not clinical events of true relevance to patients. This review discusses renal outcomes related to antidiabetic agents for type 2 diabetes, in an attempt to determine the influence of specific drugs on the incidence of diabetic kidney disease and various renal outcomes. There are marked differences among the various agents, but direct comparisons are difficult due to heterogeneous measures. Statements from Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) or European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) highlight that \u201cstandardized outcome reporting is key to achieving evidence-based guidance and improving clinical care for patients.\u201d Renal outcome studies including a well-defined, standardized core set of patient-relevant outcomes are needed. Here, we propose to define and establish major adverse renal events (MARE) as the outcome measure for future studies."

Our previous study revealed that 5-hydroxyoxindole and its 3-phenacyl-3-hydroxy derivatives showed excellent antioxidant activities such as 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and lipid-peroxidation inhibitory activity. However, the DPPH radical scavenging activity of the 3,3-disubstituted derivatives was lower than that of the original 5-hydroxyoxindole. In the present study, we synthesized novel 3-monosubstituted 5-hydroxyoxindole derivatives that exhibited stronger DPPH radical scavenging activities and lipid peroxidation-inhibitory activities than the 3,3-disubstituted 5-hydroxyoxindoles. Moreover, the 3-monosubstituted 5-hydroxyoxindole derivatives showed neither an iron-mediated pro-oxidant effect nor a remarkable cytotoxicity against HL-60 cell lines except some of the highly lipophilic compounds. These results indicate that 3-monosubstituted 5-hydroxyoxindoles can be used as a promising antioxidant scaffold for drug discovery."

UNBS5162 has been shown to have an anticancer effect in numerous cancer types, except triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). To explore this issue, TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells were selected, and the effect of UNBS5162 on their growth, proliferation and motility regulation was investigated in vitro . The results showed that UNBS5162 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells. In addition, the level of pro-apoptosis protein Bcl-2-associated X protein and active caspase-3 increased, but apotptosis regulator BCL-2 decreased in MDA-MB-231 cells after UNBS5162 treatment, which demonstrated UNBS5162 treatment triggered cell apoptosis. Moreover, UNBS5162 reduced the phosphorylation levels of AKT serine/threonine kinase (AKT), mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR), P70S6 kinase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/mTOR (PAM) signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Altogether, the results of the present study suggest that UNBS5162 effectively induces the growth inhibition and apoptosis of TNBC cells through regulation of the PAM pathway, which may be a candidate target for TNBC treatment."

It has been clearly reported that the prevalence of these diseases has been on the rise for the last few decades, but at different rates, in various areas of the world. This paper discusses the epidemiology of allergic diseases among children and their negative impact on affected patients, their families, and societies. These effects include the adverse effects on quality of life and economic costs. Medical interest has shifted from tertiary or secondary prevention to primary prevention of these chronic diseases among high-risk infants in early life. Being simple, practical, and cost-effective are mandatory features for any candidate methods delivering these strategies. Dietary therapy fits this model well, as it is simple, practical, and cost-effective, and involves diverse methods. The highest priority strategy is feeding these infants breast milk. For those who are not breast-fed, there should be a strategy to maintain beneficial gut flora that positively influences intestinal immunity. We review the current use of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics, and safety and adverse effects. Other dietary modalities of possible potential in achieving this primary prevention, such as a Mediterranean diet, use of milk formula with modified (hydrolyzed) proteins, and the role of micronutrients, are also explored. Breast-feeding is effective in reducing the risk of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic eczema among children. In addition, breast milk constitutes a major source of support for gut microbe colonization, due to its bifidobacteria and galactooligosaccharide content. The literature lacks consensus in recommending the addition of probiotics to foods for prevention and treatment of allergic diseases, while prebiotics may prove to be effective in reducing atopy in healthy children. There is insufficient evidence to support soy formulas or amino acid formulas for prevention of allergic disease. A healthy diet, such as the Mediterranean diet, may have a protective effect on the development of asthma and atopy in children. In children with asthma and allergic diseases, vitamin D deficiency correlates strongly with asthma, allergic rhinitis, and wheezing."

Unfortunately, the survival rate of metastatic BC patients remains poor due to PTX resistance. Therefore, uncovering the underlying mechanism behind the PTX resistance of BC cells is crucial for BC therapy. The enrichment of circular RNA ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 10 (circ-ABCB10), let-7a-5p and dual specificity phosphatase 7 (DUSP7) was measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in PTX-resistant and PTX-sensitive BC tissues and cells. Chemoresistance, apoptosis, invasion and autophagy of BC cells were measured by 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), flow cytometry, transwell invasion assay and Western blot assay, respectively. The binding sites between let-7a-5p and circ-ABCB10 or DUSP7 were predicted by Starbase bioinformatic software, and the combination was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The protein expression of DUSP7 was examined by Western blot assay. Murine xenograft model was established to confirm the role of circ-ABCB10 in vivo. Circ-ABCB10 depletion promoted the PTX sensitivity and apoptosis while suppressed the invasion and autophagy of PTX-resistant BC cells. Circ-ABCB10 could bind to let-7a-5p in BC cells, and circ-ABCB10 contributed to PTX resistance of BC cells via let-7a-5p. DUSP7 is a direct target of let-7a-5p in BC cells, and the accumulation of DUSP7 reversed the promoting effects of let-7a-5p overexpression on the PTX sensitivity and apoptosis and the inhibitory impact on the invasion and autophagy of PTX-resistant BC cells. Circ-ABCB10 interference suppressed the growth of BC tumors in vivo. Circ-ABCB10 mediated PTX resistance, apoptosis, invasion and autophagy of BC cells via let-7a-5p/DUSP7 axis."

The low efficiency of reprogramming and genomic integration of oncogenes and viral vectors limited the potential application of iPSCs. Here we report that Lithium (Li), a drug used to treat mood disorders, greatly enhances iPSC generation from both mouse embryonic fibroblast and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Li facilitates iPSC generation with one (Oct4) or two factors (OS or OK). The effect of Li on promoting reprogramming only partially depends on its major target GSK3\u03b2. Unlike other GSK3\u03b2 inhibitors, Li not only increases the expression of Nanog, but also enhances the transcriptional activity of Nanog. We also found that Li exerts its effect by promoting epigenetic modifications via downregulation of LSD1, a H3K4-specific histone demethylase. Knocking down LSD1 partially mimics Li's effect in enhancing reprogramming. Our results not only provide a straightforward method to improve the iPSC generation efficiency, but also identified a histone demethylase as a critical modulator for somatic cell reprogramming."

Migration of dendritic cells was also evaluated after ISS administration. In mice injected with mDC, airway hyperresponsiveness, eosinophil counts, and Th2 cytokine levels in BAL increased with increasing numbers of mDC injected. However, in mice injected with pDC, none of these changed, suggesting poor priming of T cells by pDC. In addition, mDC pulsed with ISS inhibited asthmatic reactions, and ISS administration inhibited migration of DC to the lung. We suggest that pDC played a limited role in priming T cells in this asthma model and that mDC played a major role in inducing asthma. In addition, ISS inhibited migration of DC to the lung."

        "title": "A docking model of human ribonucleotide reductase with flavin and phenosafranine",
        "abstract": "Ribonucleotide Reductase (RNR) is an enzyme responsible for the reduction of ribonucleotides to their corresponding Deoxyribonucleotides (DNA), which is a building block for DNA replication and repair mechanisms. The key role of RNR in DNA synthesis and control in cell growth has made this an important target for anticancer therapy. Increased RNR activity has been associated with malignant transformation and tumor cell growth. In recent years, several RNR inhibitors, including Triapine, Gemcitabine and GTI-2040, have entered the clinical trials. Our current work focuses on an attempted to dock this inhibitors Flavin and Phenosafranine to curtail the action of human RNR2. The docked inhibitor Flavin and Phenosafranine binds at the active site with THR176, which are essential for free radical formation. The inhibitor must be a radical scavenger to destroy the tyrosyl radical or iron metal scavenger. The iron or radical site of R2 protein can react with one-electron reductants, whereby the tyrosyl radical is converted to a normal tyrosine residue. However, compounds such as Flavin and Phenosafranine were used in most of the cases to reduce the radical activity. The docking study was performed for the crystal structure of human RNR with the radical scavengers Flavin and Phenosafranine to inhibit the human RNR2. This helps to understand the functional aspects and also aids in the development of novel inhibitors for the human RNR2."

Orientia tsutsugamushi , spotted fever group rickettsioses, and typhus group rickettsioses (TGR) are reemerging causes of acute febrile illness (AFI) in Southeast Asia. To further delineate extent, we enrolled patients >4 weeks of age with nonmalarial AFI in Sabah, Malaysia, during 2013\u20132015. We confirmed rickettsioses (past or acute, IgG titer > 160) in 126/354 (36%) patients. We confirmed acute rickettsioses (paired 4-fold IgG titer rise to > 160) in 38/145 (26%) patients: 23 O. tsutsugamushi , 9 spotted fever group, 4 TGR, 1 O. tsutsugamushi /spotted fever group, and 1 O. tsutsugamushi /TGR. PCR results were positive in 11/319 (3%) patients. Confirmed rickettsioses were more common in male adults; agricultural/plantation work and recent forest exposure were risk factors. Dizziness and acute hearing loss but not eschars were reported more often with acute rickettsioses. Only 2 patients were treated with doxycycline. Acute rickettsioses are common ( > 26%), underrecognized, and untreated etiologies of AFI in East Malaysia; empirical doxycycline treatment should be considered."

        "abstract": "There is ongoing debate about the efficacy of placebos in the treatment of mental disorders. In randomized control trials (RCTs) about the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, the administration of a psychological placebo or placement on a waiting list are the two most common control conditions. But there has never been a systematic comparison of the clinical effect of these different strategies. Compare the change in symptom severity among individuals treated with cognitive behavioral therapy, provided a psychological placebo, or placed on a waiting list using data from RCTs on generalized anxiety disorder. The following databases were searched for RCTs on generalized anxiety disorder: PubMed, PsycInfo, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, Chongqing VIP, Wanfang, Chinese Biological Medical Literature Database, and Taiwan Electronic Periodical Services. Studies were selected based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria and the quality of each included study \u2013 based on the risk of bias and the level of evidence \u2013 was formally assessed. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan5.3 and network meta-analyses comparing the three groups were conducted using R. Twelve studies with a combined sample size of 531 were included in the analysis. Compared to either control method (placebo or waiting list), cognitive behavioral therapy was more effective for generalized anxiety disorder. Provision of a psychological placebo was associated with a significantly greater reduction of symptoms than placement on a waiting list. Eight of the studies were classified as \u2018high risk of bias\u2019, and the overall level of evidence was classified as \u2018moderate\u2019, indicating that further research could change the overall results of the meta-analysis. RCTs about the treatment of generalized anxiety disorders are generally of moderate quality; they indicate the superiority of CBT but the results cannot, as yet, be considered robust. There is evidence of a non-negligible treatment effect of psychological placebos used as control conditions in research studies. This effect should be considered when designing and interpreting the results of randomized controlled trials about the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions."

Eight pediatric rhabdomyolysis cases who applied to the Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine Department of Pediatric Nephrology with different etiologies between January 2004 and January 2012 were evaluated in terms of age, gender, admission symptoms, physical examination findings, factors provoking rhabdomyolysis, number of rhabdomyolysis attacks, laboratory results, family history and the final diagnosis received after the treatment. Average diagnosis ages of eight cases were 129 (24-192) \u00b1 75.5 mo and five of them were girls. All of them had applied with the complaint of muscle pain, calf pain, and dark color urination. Infection (pneumonia) and excessive physical activity were the most important provocative factors and excessive licorice consumption was observed in one case. In 5 cases, acute kidney injury was determined and two cases needed hemodialysis. As a result of the further examinations; the cases had received diagnoses of rhabdomyolysis associated with mycoplasma pneumoniae, sepsis associated rhabdomyolysis, licorice-induced hypokalemic rhabdomyolysis, carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency, very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital muscular dystrophy and idiopathic paroxysmal rhabdomyolysis (Meyer-Betz syndrome). It is important to distinguish the sporadic and recurrent rhabdomyolysis cases from each other. Recurrent rhabdomyolysis cases should follow up more regardful and attentive."
